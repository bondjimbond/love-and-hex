    Anything in brackets that start with an exclamation mark, like this, is called a comment! It will not affect the HTML
    of your page. It's just a note from me to you!
    There's a little extra HTML I've added here to jazz up the front page, but you don't need it! If you just want basic
    HTML with p tags and h1 tags and such, that will also work just fine.

<h1>Love and Hex</h1>

<!-- The front page uses a responsive 2-column layout. This is done by first defining what content is going to be in
     the column layout, like so. -->
<div class="right-column-layout">
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be
     wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">
        <a href="/archive">
            <img src="your_content/images/cover.png"
                 alt="Love and Hex Volume 1 cover"
                 title="Click here for the archive.">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="right-column">
        <p>A retired adventurer pursues a relationship with the young night hag who once tried to steal his soul. This time... she's stolen his heart.</p>
        <p>Written and drawn by Brandon Weigel. Publishes every other Wednesday (unless I'm on vacation).</p>

        <!-- If you want to make your link look like a button, add class="button" to your 'a' tag like so: -->
        <a class="button" href="comic/001/#comic-page">First Page</a>
        <a class="button" href="latest/#comic-page">Latest Page</a>

        <!--
        If you want to set some information apart, you can set the class as "infobox"! That will put your content in a
        different block of color, which can be defined in stylesheet.css.
        -->
        <p class="infobox">The first Love and Hex print volume will soon be available to purchase!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->
