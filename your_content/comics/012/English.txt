Nanny Muk walks into the house with her soulless servant, Calvin, carrying Alond, a tiefling with swooped-back hair, tiny horns, and a pointy devil's tail. Singing Cricket greets him warmly.


Nanny: He was stuck pretty tight - had to break a couple of ribs to get him out.

Singing Cricket: Hey, ex-king, how've you been?

Alond: YOU!


Alond is dropped on the floor, battered and bruised. He glares up at Singing Cricket.

Alond: You're the one who put me here.

Singing Cricket: No, that was Calvin. Did you thank him?

Alond: You betrayed me, robbed me of my crown, and sold me to the hags!

Singing Cricket: Oh, THAT. Right.

Alond: Do you have any idea what I've had to live through since you sent me here?

Alond: *sob* It's so good to see a familiar face!
