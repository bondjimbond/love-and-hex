SC: I'm so embarrassed! I had no idea she was a -- um...


The big guy throws a punch, but singing cricket falls backwards and kicks up with his foot, hitting the student in the back of the head.

SC: Woman? She-dwarf?

SC: What do female dwarves call themselves?


The they get into position for the student to practice a takedown move. He holds Singing Cricket's arm, and puts his other hand on his bicep.

Student: Dwarf.

SC: What?


The student takes Singing Cricket to the ground with a crash.

Student: Dwarves consider gender their PRIVATE business.

Student: Doesn't matter what their sex is, they're all DWARVES.

SC, smacking into the ground: Oof, nicely done.


The student helps Singing Cricket to his feet. He is clearly interested in this topic.

Student: You have to be on pretty INTIMATE terms before most dwarves will share something that PERSONAL.

Student: Some dwarf couples don't learn each other's sex until their WEDDING NIGHT!

SC: Waaaait a minute...


Singing Cricket's eyes are wide. The student is embarrassed.

SC: You can TALK??
