1. Karya runs over to Singing Cricket happily. She is wearing her normal face again.

Kayra: "There you are, husband!"

Singing Cricket: "Hi, babe! Sorry about the distraction... things got a bit out of hand."

Kayra: "Did you have fun with your new friends?"

2. They embrace, while Singing Cricket looks back at the bartender and the dwarf. The pair are meditating.

Singing Cricket: "I could probably teach them a thing or two. Actually, I just might do that. Did you take care of your... um... hag business?"

Kayra: "Yep! And now we can just enjoy the rest of the night."

3. The couple hold hands and walk toward an abandoned party. One man cowers behind a huge tree.

Singing Cricket: "Great, let's dance! ... What happened? Everone's gone!"

Kayra: "Some lady wouldn't stop talking about herself... it made everyone uncomfortable."

4. Kayra finds the terrified man, who retreats in terror. She claps her hands.

Kayra: "Oh, the band is still here!"

5. Kayra hypnotizes the man.

Kayra: "The night isn't over. The show must go on."

6. Singing Cricket holds his lover as the man, still hypnotized, starts playing the fiddle.

Singing Cricket: "Wow, we have it all to ourselves!"

Kayra: "Dance with me."
