1. Kayra pulls a cake out of the oven, which appears to be powered by a fire elemental. Granny and Singing Cricket continue to converse while the bugs serve tea.

Singing Cricket: "Aren't you going to get Alond out from under the house? He sounds pretty rough."

Granny Dismal: "I haven't finished my tea."

2. Singing Cricket looks quite relaxed int he face of Granny's questioning. Kayra brings the cake over, wearing an apron with "Hug Your Hag" stitched on it.

Granny Dismal: "So, you're living here now."

Singing Cricket: "Yep!"

Granny Dismal: "In full possession of your soul and faculties."

Singing Cricket: "As far as I know!"

3. Granny sips her tea while Kayra and Singing Cricket kiss.

Granny Dismal: "Fascinating."

Kayra: "Oh, husband, don't let Granny Dismal frighten you. She seems stern, but really she's very sweet."

4. Kayra walks off back to the kitchen while the imp stokes the fire. Singing Cricket grins at Granny.

Granny Dismal: "Yes, I'm a big softy."

Kayra: "I just KNOW you're going to get along wonderfully!"

5. Granny Dismal leans toward Singing Cricket. Her face transforms into a grotesque horror of snakes, worms, and clawed appendages. Her tongue looks like something out of a Junji Ito manga. Her eyes stretch out of her skull. Her gigantic clawed hands reach toward Singing Cricket. He spills his tea, his mouth wide in terror.

6. Kayra returns, holding a knife. Granny is back to normal, but Singing Cricket's frozen scream remains on his face.

Kayra: "All right, who wants cake?"

Granny Dismal: "I'll cut it."
