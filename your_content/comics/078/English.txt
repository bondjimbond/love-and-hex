1. Singing Cricket skeptically responds to Alond's threats. "You want me to help you escape? You aren't chained up or anything. Why don't you just run away?"

Exasperated, Alond replies, "You think I haven't tried?!"

In the background, Kayra tries to reach the top of the giant basket, but she isn't tall enough.


2. Flashback - Alond riding a horse hard. Alond narrates in caption: "Whenever I get too far from the crone's house..."


3. Alond falls off the horse, being yanked back by a golden chain that suddenly appears around his wrist. Caption continues: "Some kind of magical force yanks me back."


4. Back to the present, Alond continues talking. "The same thing happens if I disobey, or do anything she doesn't like..."

In the background, Kayra whistles. "Fweet!"


5. Flashback: Alond in Granny Dismal's bedroom, trying to stab her while she sleeps. A golden chain holds back his hand holding the knife. He struggles against it. "...It's like an invisible thread seizes me by the wrist."


6. Singing Cricket waggles his fingers in imitation of spellcasting. "Aren't you a powerful warlock or something? Just magic it away."

Alond crosses his arms in annoyance. "Of course I am! ...But the thread blocks my spells."

Kayra, now standing on top of a deer and fishing items out of the giant basket, interjects: "You could try chopping your hand off!"


7. Lifting a barrel out of the basket with one hand, Kayra continues, "It wouldn't work, but it would be fun.

Singing Cricket crosses his arms and glares at Alond. "So you can't run away, you can't do magic, and you can't harm anyone Granny Dismal wants you to harm."

Sweating now, realizing that he's not in as advantageous a position as he'd thought, Alond tugs on his collar and grins. "That's right!"

"And you're THREATENING me."

"That's... right?"


8. Shortly afterward, Alond is tied up and gagged, bound to a tree. Kayra, Singing Cricket, the students, Dojo, the imp, and the deer all enjoy a lavish picnic together.
