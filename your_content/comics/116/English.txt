1. Kayra sits in front of her dresser, looking into a hand mirror. Tamilda stands next to her. She is asking Tamilda her option, which seems to incense the creature in the mirror behind her.

Kayra: "Tamilda, help me pick out a new look for the market."

Tamilda: "Sure! Why do you need a new look?"

Kayra: "For some reason, people get SUSPICIOUS if they know they're dealing with a HAG."


2. Kayra changes her appearance several times. She narrates:

"So - what should I be?"

"An elf?" (looking like Marcille from Dungeon Meshi)

"A human? Or is that too conventional?" (looking like the human illusion used by Kayra's changeling)

"A tiefling?" (looking like a rather sexy tiefling, in a short skirt and corset, with big horns and a long pointy tail)

Tamilda looking flushed: "Tiefling. Definitely tiefling."


3. Kayra snaps her fingers, and the glamour dissipates. Tamilda touches her fingers together and looks up, clearly having her own agenda. The mirror creature looks bored.

Kayra: "All right! I'll put it on when we get there."

Tamilda: "Soo... does that magic only work on yourself, or could you do it to another person, too?"


4. Kayra puts down her hand mirror. Tamilda looks away, a little embarrassed. The mirror creature yawns, bored at not being involved.

Kayra: "Sure! What are you thinking?"

Tamilda: "Well... I'd like to know what it's like having bigger... You know... like yours."


5. An intimate panel. Kayra leans over and puts a hand on Tamilda, who smiles shyly and looks away.

Kayra: "Oh, sweetie -- you know it will just be an ILLUSION, right?"

Tamilda: "I know... I just want to try it out."


6. Kayra grins and snaps her fingers: "Okay!" A cloud envelops Tamilda with a POOF.


7. Kayra smiles happiy watching Tamilda, who eagerly looks in the mirror, absolutely pleased with her new, very big hair.

Tamilda: "Coooool!"
