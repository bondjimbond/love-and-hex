1. Alond struggles to change the baby's diaper while Singing Cricket and Kayra discuss the story of how she found him.

Kayra: "...and on my way home, I found the baby under a bush!"

Singing Cricket: "Wait, why haven't I seen that outfit before?" [See Love and Hex #33]

Alond: "Will you two keep quiet? I'm TRYING to concentrate!"

2. Kayra kisses Singing Cricket on the cheek. Alond manages to pin the diaper shut.

Kayra: "I'll wear it tonight."

Alond: "This is harder than it looks."

3. Singing Cricket slaps Alond on the back. He does not look pleased. The baby touches his nose.

Singing Cricket: "Look at you, being a dad! I didn't think you were the type."

Alond: "Nanny is MAKING me take care of it."

4. The baby hangs by his tail from Alond's arm like a cute little demon monkey..

Alond: "It's NOT mine, you know. He's, what, six months old? I've been trapped here for EIGHT."

Singing Cricket: "I'm not sure it works like that."

5. Singing Cricket opines.

Singing Cricket: "I'd have thought you'd be HAPPY about this."

Alond (off-panel): "Why?!"

Singing Cricket: "If he's yours, then he's part of the royal bloodline, right?"

6. Alond ponders. The baby clings to his back.

Singing Cricket: "And King Crispin hasn't married yet..."

Alond: "Which would make MY SON... the royal HEIR!"

7. Alond Lifts the baby into the air with joy. Kayra is puzzled, but Singing Cricket shushes her.

Alond: "My BOY! Are you hungry? Do you need a drink? A cigar? Daddy will take GOOD care of his little prince!"

Kayra: "Does a deposed king's bastard have ANY legal status?"

Singing Cricket: "Let him have this."
