1. Kayra lets Tamilda into the house. She grins at her.

Kayra: "Hi, sweetie! What can I do for you?"

Outside, Singing Cricket scolds Charlie: "Bad Charlie! We do NOT maul our guests!"


2. Tamilda looks shyly away from Kayra as she makes her request.

Tamilda: "I was wondering if, maybe... You wanted to... Hang out... Together?"

Kayra gasps in astonishment.


3. Kayra grins and shakes her fists in excited happiness: "EEEEEEEEEEEE"

Tamilda's eyes widen in surprise.


4. Kayra continues to scream: "EEEEEEEEEEEEE".. Kayra turns to Singing Cricket, who is entering the house with a torn sleeve and scratches all over his head. His drink is still intact. 

Tamilda: "What's wrong with her?"


5. Kayra, looking serious, seizes Tamilda by the shoulders. Tamilda has a shocked expression.

Kayra: "I've never had a girlfriend before! We're going to have so much FUN!"


6. Tamilda looks at Singing Cricket again: "Is it too late to change my mind?"

Kayra drags her out the door as Singing Cricket waves. "Yep! Let's go."
