In the background, Charlie the owlbear looms over Kayra, who struggles to calm him down. In the foreground, Singing Cricket talks nervously with Granny Dismal.

Granny Dismal: "An owlbear is an unorthodox choice for a pet..."

Singing Cricket, looking relieved: "Oh, no, you think so? It's too bad, but you're right, I should send him back..."


Charlie, on his back two legs, swipes his burly arm across the panel and sends Kayra flying out of the picture. A word balloon follows her: "Whoops!"

Granny stops Singing Cricket from reaching for Charlie's rope: "--BUT it is a worthy challenge. I am SURE you are up to the task."

SInging Cricket, looking unhappy: "Urk! I am???"


Granny ignores the loud CRASH behind them, as Singing Cricket glances around and twiddles his fingers, ever more anxious.

Granny: "Certainly. I am fully confident that, under your tutelage, Charlie can become a MODEL of obedience and docility in as little as, let's say, two weeks."

Singing Cricket: "Right! Sure. I... appreciate your faith in me."


Charlie runs past with the cooking pot on his head. Kayra is chasing after him, shouting, "Give that back!"


Charlie runs between Granny and Singing Cricket, exploding out of the panel, with an angry imp tugging on his ear tufts trying to control him.


Kayra looks sadly into her empty cooking pot, hydra heads scattered around the ruined kitchen.

Singing Cricket, grinning hopefully: "It might take a LITTLE longer--"

Granny Dismal: "You have two weeks."
