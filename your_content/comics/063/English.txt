1. Granny Dismal's large house nuzzles its baby affectionately. Singing Cricket watches. Meanwhile, Kayra protests at Granny, who is still holding an axe. "Granny! We can't KILL the baby house!"

"It's a runt!" Granny replies. "Barely hatched, and it's already a ramshackle wreck!"


2. Granny continues as Kayra glares at her. "It's too scrawny to hunt on its own. And it's useless as a house... No kitchen, no interior walls, not a STICK of furniture..."

Meanwhile, Singing Cricket puts his head through the tiny house's door.


3. Singing Cricket, seen from inside the house. He gasps in astonishment.


4. The interior of the house looks like a Japanese martial arts dojo. It is much bigger on the inside than on the outside. In captions, Granny speaks: "...And the floor isn't even SOLID. It's soft and yielding. It's revolting."

Tears well in Singing Cricket's eyes. "It's WONDERFUL," he murmurs.


5. Granny turns to him and points at the baby house with her axe. "You see? Utterly useless. Best to put it out of its misery."

Singing Cricket looks sad, and replies, "Yeah, you're right..."


6. He takes the axe from Granny, who smiles. "I'll do it." Kayra gasps in horror.
