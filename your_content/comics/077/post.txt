This was the very first Love and Hex episode. It was not originally intended to be an ongoing series -- rather, it was just a gag for my friends.

After our four-year campaign finally ended, when the king was deposed, the demilich was defeated, and the great war was stopped, I asked the players, "What will your characters do now?"

The player of Singing Cricket, our Drunken Master Monk, said, "I'd like to see where things go with that [night hag who had a crush on me](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndstories/comments/k62rrv/the_death_of_the_ranger/)."

The idea amused me so much, I sketched out a quick comic depicting their life together as a TV sitcom.

Then I shared it with the r/DnD community on Reddit. They loved it, and asked for more.

The second episode blew up, and someone suggested I post it on Webtoons.

This strange relationship continued to inspire me, so I continued to draw. And suddenly, I've got a webcomic.
