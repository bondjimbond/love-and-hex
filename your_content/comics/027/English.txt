1. Tamilda is at the door, dressed in her armour, trying to sneak out. Her backpack is almost bursting trying to contain an enormous egg. She grimaces as she's caught leaving by a voice off-panel: "Tamilda? Where are you going?"


2. It's Singing Cricket and Kayra. Singing Cricket is holding a drink, as usual. With the door open and a full moon behind her, Tamilda pastes a grin on her face. "Look, Singing Cricket... It was great seeing you, but... I have things to take care of back home."


3. Singing Cricket and Tamilda hug. "Goodbye!" says Singing Cricket. "I'll miss you."

"I still kind of want to kill her," replies Tamilda.

"I know."


4. "Come back soon!" says Kayra. Tamilda throws her arms around Kayra's neck. "Ooh, hugs!" says Kayra, surprised.


5. The door slams behind them as Kayra and Singing Cricket talk. Granny Dismal looks at them. "That was so nice!" says Kayra. "Your friends should visit more." Granny Dismal replies, "Where is your soul bag?" Kayra's neck is uncharacteristically bare.


6. Kayra looks down in surprise at where her soul bag used to be. Further into the house, Nanny Muk angrily chases after Alond, firing bolts of lightning at him from her hands. The nest he'd been sitting on is charred and empty. Alond, eyes wide in fear, shouts, "I swear, I haven't seen the dragon egg!"


7. Granny, for the first time in this comic, smiles. "Impressive work," she says, "I LIKE this child."
