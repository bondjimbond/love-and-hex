1. Two girls, Amanda and Danna (from the webcomic The Astral Diaries) arrive at the door of Nanny Muk's house. Kayra answers, dressed in a fuzzy red suit and hat, sipping a holly martini. Singing Cricket is close behind, shirtless. The girls offer him a package; he eagerly accepts.

Kayra: "Oh! The house didn't eat you. Hello!"
Amanda: "Um, hi! We think this belongs to you?"

2. Kayra invites the girls inside, while Singing Cricket takes the package to the counter to open it. A tag that says "From Granny" falls to the floor, unnoticed. Amanda looks around with interest; Danna looks more tentative.

Kayra: "You brought my husband a present! How sweet."
Danna: "It was just misdelivered."

3. Kayra digs into a chest. Danna stares at her butt. Amanda, meanwhile, watches Singing Cricket, who has just opened his package -- a mimic, which attacks him. He looks dismayed.

Singing Cricket: "Aargh! Not again!"
Kayra: "Even so, you deserve something too!"

4. Kayra brings out a large, glowing gem, and offers it to the girls. They both reach for it, fascinated.

Kayra: "I found a pile of these behind the house."
Amanda: "Ooh!"
Kayra: "Take it. We have lots!"

5. The girls leave, holding the gem together (which is pretty much holding hands). Kayra stands at the door, waving goodbye, while Singing Cricket wrestles the mimic on the lawn.

Amanda: "Bye! Thank you!"
Danna, looking down at the gem: "It's sticky."

6. Close-up on the girls' hands. They are holding the gem, but they are touching. The gem, unnoticed, opens an eye and looks up at the girls... a baby mimic.

Danna: "Amanda, I don't think I can let go."
Amanda: "That's all right."
