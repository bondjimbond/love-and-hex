1. Singing Cricket walks up to Kayra, who is wearing a "Hug Your Hag" apron and solumnly chopping up some sort of large hunk of meat. Blood splatters everywhere.

Singing Cricket: "Dinner looks interesting. What are you making?"
Kayra: "Dinner? Ask Nanny... I don't feel like cooking."

2. Singing Cricket is puzzled, but his protests are interrupted by a mechanical blue and grey bird - the Tweeter - flying through the window onto Kayra's finger.

Singing Cricket: "But then... what are you..."
Tweeter: "The wedding of Kayra Carpenter and Jonathan Nordhall will take place this Saturday at the Mended Goat in Kingsport."
Kayra: "Ooh, swanky!"
Tweeter: "We hope you and your whole family will come!"

3. Singing Cricket takes the Tweeter from Kayra. Alond looks in, gasping, from off-panel, clearly coveting the bird.

Kayra: "What's this device? It spoke in other-Kayra's voice!"
Singing Criket: "That's the Tweeter! I lent it to her so she could reach us, since the postmen keep getting abducted by trees. I didn't know it had direct messaging."

4. Kayra holds her hands together and smiles dreamily. From off-panel, Alond reaches to grab the bird.

Kayra: "A wedding! Two souls, bound to each other forever! With food, and dancing, and throwing the bouquet..."
Singing Cricket: "Yeah! It'll be fun!"

5. Kayra grabs Singing Cricket by the lapels, suddenly looking very serious. He grins, worriedly.

Kayra: "Husband... I am GOING to catch that bouquet."
Singing Cricket: "Haha, sure, it's a fun tradition."

6. Kayra looks VERY INTENSE, and terrifying, her eyes big and distorted, and her text scratchy and crazy. Singing Cricket sweats as she says:

Kayra: "And then, soon, it will be OUR TURN"
