(A crow clutching a scroll in its talons enters the house through the window, as Nanny Muk stands in front of a stove. A racoon stirs her cooking pot.)

Crow: Awk! Message from Granny Dismal!

Nanny: h, thank you, dear.


(Nanny breaks the crow's neck and throws it into the pot.)


(Kayra is throwing knives, axes, and other sharp objects at Singing Cricket, who is blindfolded. An imp stands by with throwing stars, next to an urn full of weapons. Nanny reads the message.)

Nanny: Granny Dismal says she's coming back early!


(Kayra looks upset, turning toward Nanny. Distracted, she throws her knife directly at Singing Cricket's face.)

Kayra: What? She's not supposed to be here till next month!


(Knife approaches Singing Cricket's face. He does not react.)

Singing Cricket: Isn't that good news?


(With lightning speed and precision, Singing Cricket's hand snatches the knife out of the air.)

Kayra (off-panel): Not exactly... I haven't told her about us!


(Singing Cricket removes his blindfold, and passes the knife back to Kayra.)

Singing Cricket, laughing: I'm sure it will be fine. What's she going to do, kill me?

Kayra, annoyed: Don't be silly!


(Kayra walks away, pursued by the imp carrying the urn full of weapons. She balances the knife on her finger. Singing Cricket looks horrified.)

Kayra: Granny can keep a man alive for months.
