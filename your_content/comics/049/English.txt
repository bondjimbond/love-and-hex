The dwarf, smiling through a thick beard, lays a hand on Tamilda's shoulder to comfort her. Tamilda remains angry.

D: Don't fret, lass. Yer body's just goin' through some changes.

T: I know! That's the PROBLEM I'm trying to FIX!


Singing Cricket struggles to explain things to Tamilda. Luckily he brought Kayra along.

SC: I know you're confused, Tamilda, but, well... I'm the wrong person to ask. 

SC: Everyone at the monastery was MALE.

Kayra crouches down and takes Tamilda's hand. 

K: Hi, sweetie! I'm here to help.


Kayra, smiling gently, leads a confused Tamilda by the hand. Singing Cricket and the dwarf follow, the dwarf glancing at SC.

K: I'm sure you have lots of questions. I'll make some tea, and we'll have a nice chat with nanny and granny.


Kayra and Tamilda enter Nanny Muk's cottage. Singing Cricket goes to follow, but the dwarf holds a hand up to stop him.

D: Er... Let's leave this one to the LADIES, shall we?

SC, blushing: Oh! Yes. Right. Of course.


Singing Cricket tries to talk to the dwarf, but the dwarf enters the house instead.

SC: All right, then! Shall we resume -- um...


The door shuts with a click. Singing Cricket holds his chin thoughtfully.

SC: ...

SC: I guess I should have asked.
