1. Kayra sits on Singing Cricket's lap. The two of them are on what initially looks like a chair but is actually a large-mouthed creature bending backwards. They are sitting in its mouth. Granny Dismal eats scorpions from a bowl while sitting on an ooze. Its pseudopods act like arm rests.

Kayra: "Granny, please be nice to my husband. He loves me."

Granny Dismal: "Of course."

2. Kayra and Singing Cricket give each other butterfly kisses while Granny walks away.

Granny Dismal: "Oh dear, your glass is empty. Let me make you another drink."

3. Granny's hand, finger extended, goes over an assortment of poisons and venoms.

Kayra, off-panel: "See? She likes you!"

4. Granny squeezes a poisonous frog and a vial of basilisk oil into a martini glass, garnished with an eyeball. Labeled containers of other poisons surround it. Alond peeks around the corner, a horrified look on his face.

5. Granny stirs the concoction. Its fumes cause the flowers in a nearby vase to wilt. Alond grimaces, worried.

6. Granny passes the drink to Singing Cricket, who takes it happily. Behind him, Alond tries to get his attention.

Alond: "Psst!"

Singing Cricket: "Looks great! Thanks!"

7. Alond tries to get his attention, but Singing Cricket shushes him and guzzles the beverage down. Kayra takes a scorpion.

Alond: "Stop! She poison--"

Singing Cricket: "Hush."

8. Singing Cricket, drink finished, holds his glass out to Granny. Granny gives a slight smile. Kayra is delighted. Alond is in shock.

Singing Cricket: "Delicious! Got anything stronger?"

Granny: "All right, you can keep him. (for now)"
