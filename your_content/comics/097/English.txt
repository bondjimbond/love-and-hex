1. Walking through the woods, Tamilda comes upon a tiny little log house with a thatch roof and a bent chimney -- Dojo. Unseen by Tamilda in the shade of the house, an owlbear, Charlie, rests.

Tamilda: "Weird... That little house wasn't here before."


2. Tamilda approaches the house and peers in the window. Charlie wakes up and looks at her, eyes wide with surprise.

Tamilda: "I wonder who lives in it?"


3. The house rises up on its huge chicken legs, surprising Tamilda. As it looms over her she backs away, drawing her sword with an "ACK!" This angers Charlie, who bares his teeth as he approaches her.


4. Caption: "Later..."

Singing Cricket sits in his slime chair, drink in hand, reading the Good House-Keeping book. His feet rest on an ottoman, covered in eyes and a sharp-toothed mouth, which is also both reading a book and raising a glass to Singing Cricket at the same time. It is part of the mimic house. A drinks cabinet full of liquor and poison grins -- also part of the mimic house. The imp sits on the floor near Singing Cricket, reading a newspaper. In the background, ants carry construction materials.

From off-panel, a "KNOCK KNOCK" is heard.


5. Singing Cricket answers the door, drink still in hand. He looks surprised when he looks outside.

Singing Cricket: "Tamilda?"

Tamilda, off-panel: "Hi, Singing Cricket..."


6. View shifts to outside. Tamilda is visible now. She has an exasperated expression on her face as Charlie, the huge owlbear, angrily gnaws on her head. She is completely undamaged by this attack and just looks tired. Singing Cricket looks on blankly.

Tamilda: "Is Kayra home?"
