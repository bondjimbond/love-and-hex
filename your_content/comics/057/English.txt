1. A panel repeated from #56: Granny talking to Tamilda as she eats pie. The dragon eyes the half-finished pie dish on the table.

Granny: "If you are QUITE finished playing, we still have important matters to discuss."

Tamilda: "Hmm? Oh, I think I've got the wolf stuff figured out..."

Granny: "No... your DRAGON."


2. The conversation from the previous page continues in the background, but the focus is now on the dragon. He opens his mouth wide, ready to devour the pie.


3. Before he can eat the pie, the dragon falls to the floor with a WHUMP! In the corner, a zombified ant chases a beetle.


4. Nanny Muk, her face still covered in tumours, holds the dragon's tail and glares at him. "No, dearie. You've had ENOUGH pie." The dragon looks back at her forlornly.


5. Nanny continues, "But you've eaten so much already." The dragon pouts and looks like he's going to cry. "Hmm. You really like it, don't you?"


6. Nanny grins. "Should I make another?" The dragon's face lights up.


7. Nanny points coyly at the dragon, who cringes with embarrassment. "Well, you must be a GOOD little dragon. No more fighting with the imp?"


8. Close-up on Nanny's horrifying face and claws. "And do you promise to always do everything Nanny Muk says?" The dragon nods eagerly.


9. A spectral collar appears around the dragon's neck, as Nanny Muk says, in a speech balloon with inverted colours, "Then it's a deal."


10. Nanny, with her arm around the happy little dragon's shoulders, walks toward the kitchen. "Let's make some pie."
