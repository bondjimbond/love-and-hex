1. A little girl dressed as a witch and clutching a jack-o-lantern-shaped goodie basket walks through a cemetery late at night with her cat.


2. Behind her, hands start to rise up from the ground, and the sound of groaning can be heard.


3. A horde of zombies approaches the girl, and she finally notices: "Oh!"


4. A zombie lurches toward her, ready to attack, but the girl is unafraid. With a smile, she proffers a candy, saying, "Here you go!"


5. The zombie looks puzzled at the candy in her hand, while the child distributes more candy to the other zombies in the graveyard. "And one for you... and you... and you... and you..." The cat assists.


6. The girl leaves the cemetery through the gate and waves at the zombies. "See you next year!" The zombies, smiling and holding their candies, smile and wave back.
