Baetzzi was part of the party's adventures for a good chunk of the campaign, her soul inhabiting the goggles you've seen Cirra wearing in her appearances. Most of the problems in the game (including the death of Tamilda's parents) came up because the party were trying to help Baetzzi return to life.

Her whole deal is a saga. She's one of my favourite NPCs. And the party -- Cirra in particular -- love her, despite all the bad stuff.
