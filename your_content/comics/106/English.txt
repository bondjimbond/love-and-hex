1. A surprised Tamilda, with hairy wolf arms, holds Calvin's soul bag and stares up at the handsome, muscular spirit coming out of it. Spirit-Calvin bows and grins, in sharp contrast to the vacant stare of meat-Calvin, who is holding hands with Nanny Muk.

Nanny Muk: "Calvin, dear, we have guests."

Calvin: "Oh! I am a bit tired, but I suppose we could chat before I go back in."


2. Tamilda is nonplussed. "Hang on... you WANT to stay in the soul bag?

Calvin grins, holding Nanny's hand. "Of course! While my soul and body are apart, I don't AGE. This is how my sweet Gretchen and I can be together FOREVER."

Nanny Muk, smaller: "It's Nanny Muk now, dear."


3. Tamilda looks incredulously at Calvin's wrinkled, balding, liver-spotted body.

Tamilda: "You look pretty aged to ME."

Calvin, grinning shyly: "Well... it HAS been two centuries."

Nanny Muk, slyly: "He likes to come out to play on occasion."


4. Tamilda remains incredulous while Calvin's soul and Nanny act affectionate with each other.

Tamilda: "You're tlling me Calvin AGREED to let you take his soul?"

Nanny Muk: "Naturally. Consent is VERY important in my line."


5. Tamilda points angrily at Calvin's body. "Come on - LOOK at yourself! Did you REALLY know what you were agreeing to?"

Calvin touches his body's head sadly. "Sigh... no, it's true..."


6. Calvin examines his body's head more closely. "...I REALLY thought I'd keep more of my HAIR."
