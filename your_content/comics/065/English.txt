1. Singing Cricket has brought his two students, the talkative dwarf and the silent big guy, to the woods. A tiny house - the baby house he's been protecting, sits on the ground nearby. "Come on," says Singing Cricket, "I want to introduce you to someone."

"All right..." replies the dwarf. "Are they inside the wee house then?"


2. The two students react with puzzlement and shock when the baby house extends its chicken legs and starts getting up. Singing Cricket smiles, pats it on the roof, and says, "The ARE the wee house! Go on in!"


3. With a "Seriously??" the dwarf has to crouch down and squeeze to get through the tiny doorway, but she enters. The big guy watches in curious fascination. Singing Cricket strokes the house's thatch. "You be good and stay here. We can't let Granny Dismal find you."


4. Inside the house, Singing Cricket struggles to pull the big guy inside. He's too large for the doorway, and his shoulders are stretching the doorframe. The dwarf, meanwhile, stands in awe looking at the house's large dojo interior.

"Good gods..." marvels the dwarf. "It's bigger on the INSIDE! How is this possible??"

Singing Cricket grunts as he struggles with the big guy. "Who am I -- urg -- some kind of doctor?"


5. The big guy flies out of the doorway with a POP.


6. The trio land in a heap - Singing Cricket squished under the big guy, the dwarf on top. The big guy looks around in amazement: "It's incredible." The dwarf's eyes go wide, witnessing him talk for the first time ever.


7. The dwarf's eyes narrow. "Say that again."


8. The big guy looks up at the dwarf, gritting his teeth nervously. "..."


9. The dwarf grabs the big guy's head and twists it around, yelling at him in a rage. "Three years! Three years we've known each other, and ye've not spoken one bloody WORD! SAY IT AGAIN!"
