1. Kayra, her mouth and dress covered in sausage juices, speaks with Singing Cricket while Nanny Muk plays with the baby behind them.

Singing Cricket: "Nanny Muk is surprisingly good with Children!"

Kayra: "Of course! Look how well she raised me!"


2. Alond comes by with a scowl on his face and snatches a sausage off of the plate in front of Kayra. "Ugh, are we REALLY going to add a smelly little poop monster to this house of horrors?" 

Affronted, Kayra replies, "Don't be silly!"


3. Kayra continues, "Nanny hasn't summoned a poop monster in YEARS!"

Singing Cricket: "And he's going back to his parents soon, right?"


4. Off-panel, Kayra replies, "If we can find them!" 

Nanny Muk hands the baby over to Alond. "Hold this for me." Alond is not pleased.


5. Alond retches, holding the baby awkwardly by an arm and a leg. The baby smiles. 

Alond: "Yech."

Singing Cricket teases the baby's hair, which forms a little swoosh shape similar to Alond's. "Come on, he's actually kind of cute. Look at that little tuft of hair!" Kayra adds, "He looks a bit like you!"


6. Alond glares at Kayra, angry at the impertinence of her suggestion. He points at the baby's chest. "Don't compare ME to this hideous foundling. I am of ROYAL blood. THIS little peasant..."

The baby looks at his finger. "Ba?"


7. Alond's eyes widen and he stares at the baby. "Um..." he stammers, as a tail just like his slips out of the baby's diaper and wraps around his pointing finger. "Ba!" says the baby, smiling.
