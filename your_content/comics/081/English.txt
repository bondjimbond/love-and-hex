Page 81 from the comic Love and Hex.


1. Kayra, a young night hag, pulls a tray of cookies from her living oven. She wears an apron that says "Hug Your Hag." In the background, her partner, Singing cricket, sniffs the air. She says, "A perfect golden brown! I'll leave it on the windowsill to cool."


2. Singing Cricket enjoys the aroma of the cookies. "Mmm... Gingerbread!" he says, and reaches for one.


3. Kayra appears, wielding a spatula and looking upset. "Don't eat that!" she shouts, as Singing Cricket brings the gingerbread to his mouth. "Why not??" he asks, with a worried expression.


4. Kayra takes the tray and walks away, saying, "I'm saving up for a house!"


Singing Cricket falls over with a "plop" reminiscent of E.C. Segar's Popeye comics.
