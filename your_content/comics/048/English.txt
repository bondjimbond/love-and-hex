A comic page. Singing Cricket, Drunken Master monk, is training his students by having them balance glasses of beer on their heads, when his young friend Tamilda arrives with the young dragon who hatched from the egg she stole from Granny Dismal.


T: Singing Cricket!

SC: Tamilda! And... a dragon?

T: I need your help.


Tamilda sits down on a stump. The bartender scratches the dragon's head, while the dwarf spills the beer. SC takes down his glass to drink, but leaves a wine bottle on his head.


T: After I left the hags last month, strange things have been happening. I think they CURSED me.

SC: Why would they do that? Granny LIKES you.


As the dwarf wrings the beer out of their beard, the dragon plops its head onto Singing Cricket's lap, as if answering the question.


SC: Oh. Well... What are the curses effects?


Singing Cricket scratches the dragon's head.


T: Well... I woke up feeling awful, with BLOOD on my sheets.

T: I feel angry, even when there's no REASON.

T: And... There's HAIR growing in places it's never grown before.


Singing Cricket arches his eyebrows.


SC: Hang on... How old are you again?

T: Twelve.


Singing Cricket springs up and runs off-panel, with a panicked look on his face. The wine bottle falls of his head and his beer spills all over the dragon.


T: KAYRA!
