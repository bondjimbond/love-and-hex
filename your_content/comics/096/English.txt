1. Tamilda sits head down at her writing desk, frustratedly shouting "Aargh!" Behind her is the complete "Women I know" list, with nine names of friendship candidates, all crossed out for one reason or another.

The complete list:

    Kipo (dead)
    Cirra - Druid - wolf form! Something in common? THINKS SHE'S MY MOTHER!
    Baetzzi - Drow - automatically cool. Knows magic! Singing Cricket called her a lich, but she seemed OK?
            To do: Look up "Lich" <-WTF?!
    Lady Malicia - Next door, cool old lady vibes. Said to come back when I'm 18 =(
    Verity - Badass devil lady. Lives in Hell (pro or con?) (drawing of a skull)
    Eliza! Hot sorceress (TOO hot)
    Melody River - Amazing bard (DEMON), everyone loves her(BRAINWASHED), SO pretty. Dating (EATING) the king
        May need to kill her later
    The weird dwarf who lives in the woods?
        Just yells at trees all day.
    Suzie Mav
        Tried to drink my BLOOD! (She's not even really a vampire!)


2. With angry expression, Tamilda continues her list: "10. Kayra the night hag"


3. Close-up of the list with her pen hand poised over it. Kayra's entry has three addenda:

    SCARY!
    Killed my friend
    Family wants to eat me (?)

She growls as she writes these: "Grrrr"


4. "Hmm..." Tamilda narrows her eyes and sucks the back of her pen as she looks at her additions to the list:

    I tried to kill her... She didn't make it weird.
    Singing Cricket likes her...


5. With a determined look, Tamilda scribbles on her page.


6. In full armour, sword at her side, Tamilda ventures in to the scary, dangerous wood. Evil-looking trees stare at her, spiked vines reach for her, menacing creatures watch her, but she strides forward ignoring them. With a "Sigh..." she drops her list.

The paper floats toward the reader, showing Kayra's entry and Tamilda's final note, circled: "She's nice to me."
