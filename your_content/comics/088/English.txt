1. Charlie the owlbear is sitting calmly next to Dojo, the baby house. The dwarf watches in astonishment as Singing Cricket holds an apple out to Charlie. Kayra holds Singing Cricket's hand.

Kayra: "Charlie is so docile since I saw him last! What happened?"

Singing Cricket: "I have a theory about that..."


2. The dwarf is even more astonished as Singing Cricket scratches Charlie's head without getting bitten. In fact, Charlie seems to be enjoying it.

Singing Cricket: "You know how when baby birds hatch, they imprint on the first thing they see? I think when Dojo knocked Charlie on the head, it sort of... RESET him."


3. Charlie nuzzles the house. As Singing Cricket and Kayra discuss this phenomenon, the dwarf picks out an apple.

Kayra: "So Dojo is his mum now?"

Singing Cricket: "And we're his flock!"


4. Kayra and Singing Cricket walk away. In the background, the dwarf holds an apple out to Charlie.

Kayra: "So Charlie has imprinted on Dojo... But what keeps him from attacking YOU!"

Singing Cricket, slyly reaching into his lapel: "Ah, there's a trick..."


5. Singing Cricket and Kayra continue their walk away through the woods. Singing Cricket holds out a clump of thatch.

Singing Cricket: "Owlbears have sensitive noses. I keep a bit of Dojo's thatch on me... He smells his mother -- and I'm part of the family!"

Kayra clasps her hands in delight: "Husband, you're so clever! Granny will be impressed!"


6. Singing Cricket continues from off panel: "Maybe... But without Dojo's thatch, I wouldn't go NEAR him."

Cut back to Charlie and Dojo. Charlie continues to sit contentedly, the dwarf's feet sticking out of his mouth.
