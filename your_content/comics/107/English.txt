1. Tamilda walks into the house, carrying an enormous egg with help from Calvin's soulless body. Nanny reaches for it eagerly.

Tamilda: "So, Nanny... Are you really saying that everything you do to people - the curses, the soul-stealing, the ironic punishemnts... The victims all AGREED to it?"

Nanny Muk: "BROADLY, dearie. Broadly."


2. Nanny, without any help or apparent effort, cracks the giant egg into her boiling pot.

Nanny Muk: "Sometimes they make bad deals... And sometimes their own ACTIONS demand CONSEQUENCES. That's implied consent... the Golden Rule.  Sure, they don't always understand WHAT they've agreed to... but they COULD just ASK."


3. Nanny cheerfully stirs her pot as she continues her speech. Tamilda, meanwhile, is helping out by chopping mushrooms. The mushrooms seem to have little feet.

Nanny Muk: "Whatever happens to someone who meets a hag is the result of their own actions. Only the greedy, the vicious, and the foolish have anything to fear from US."

Tamilda, skeptically: "Those are pretty broad categories."

Nanny Muk: "We like to keep busy."


4. A shirtless man with the face of a Tengu - a monstrous Japanese yokai - approaches to take a mushroom from the basket. When he speaks, Tamilda reacts in horror, shouting and tossing her mushroom.

Man: "It's true, you know."

Tamilda: "Waugh!"


5. The man removes his Tengu mask, showing himself to be Singing Cricket, and takes a bite of a mushroom.

Singing Cricket: "Something to do with their Faerie origins. They may trick and manipulate people, but hags are FUNDAMENTALLY honest. They're actually INCAPABLE of lying!"

Tamilda, reaching for another mushroom: "REally? How did you learn that?"


6. Singing Cricket is led away by the hand by Kayra, wearing a yukata and an Oni mask. He continues eating mushrooms while being led away.

Singing Cricket: "Oh... Granny Dismal told me."

Tamilda smacks her forehead in frustration.
