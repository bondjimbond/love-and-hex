Page 17 of the comic Love and Hex, in six panels.


1. Alond, the former king of the realm who is now the indentured servant of the hag coven, approaches Singing Cricket, who is enjoying a beer. The little imp, Kayra's familiar, is enjoying a sandwich. Singing Cricket grins at the imp.

Alond: "All right, I think the hags are all asleep. We're finally free to plan..."


2. The imp has cut his sandwich in half, and Singing Cricket has poured him a small beer. The two are enjoying this mutually beneficial arrangement.

Alond: "...our ESCAPE."

Singing Cricket: "Hmm?"

Alond, looking concerned: "You don't need to act tough with me. I GET it. We're in this TOGETHER."


3. Alond casually picks up the imp's sandwich, much to its annoyance. He grins smarmily at Singing Cricket.

Alond: "We're friends now. Heck, I don't even remember what our conflict was about."

Singing Cricket, annoyed: "Nonhuman slavery."

Alond: "Completely forgotten, pal."


4. Alond puts his arm around Singing Cricket's shoulder, while the imp readies its tail to sting him.

Alond: "You'll feel better if you get it off your chest. You know how I'VE suffered... What kind of sick, degrading things are they forcing YOU to do?"


5. Singing Cricket blushes as, off panel, Kayra calls out: "Husband, come back to bed!"

Meanwhile, the imp stings Alond on the hand, paralyzing him.


6. Singing Cricket gets up. Alond is frozen, either from the imp's venom or from shock, while the imp gets back to his sandwich.

Singing Cricket: "Sorry, duty calls."
