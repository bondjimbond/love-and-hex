1. Singing Cricket draws his dagger and glares at Nanny, who is backing away from the angry dragon. "Nanny Muk, that is NOT how we treat our guests!"

Tamilda, a knife blade still protruding from her chest, looks in shock at her bloody hands. "She... she STABBED me?!"

Kayra approaches from behind.


2. Granny sips her tea as chaos goes on around her. Singing Cricket approaches Nanny while the dragon blasts her with its radiation breath. Her skeleton is exposed by the rays, revealing that she is not as short as she seems to be.

Granny: "Really, Nanny Muk. So needlessly DRAMATIC."

Kayra approaches a terrified Tamilda and grasps the knife handle. "Let me get that for you, sweeite."


3. Kayra yanks the knife out of Tamilda's body. Tamilda touches her chest in surprise. "I'm... I'm fine?"

Granny replies, "As Nanny Muk so VISCERALLY demonstrated, lycanthropy has its advantages."


4. Tamilda's eyes widen and she smiles with understanding. "You mean I'm... invincible?"

"Not quite," replies Granny. In the background, Singing Cricket scratches his head. Nanny crosses her arms and sticks her tongue out at the puzzled dragon.


5. Using the bloody knife, Nanny cuts up the pie and begins serving it while Granny talks.

Granny: "The moon's power makes you impervious to MOST of the tools of man's violence... But you ARE still vulnerable. Avoid fire, magic, and above all, silver."

Tamilda, is thinking about something else and does not seem to be paying attention to that warning. "Hmm? Sounds great."


6. Tamilda runs off excitedly, grabbing Singing Cricket's hand. "Come on, Singing Cricket! Teach me how to catch arrows!"

Kayra claps her hands. "Ooh! I call first shot!"
