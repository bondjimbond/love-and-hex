CAPTION: Singing Cricket was accidentally turned into a frog.

(Kayra, crouching, holds the frog in her hands.)

Singing Cricket: So could you, um... change me back?

Kayra: But you look so cute!


Kayra, hand on chin, looking pensive: Oh, all right. Every hex has a countercharm, we just have to find it. It's granny's recipe. She's very traditional...


(Kayra looking happy and enamoured with hands clasped together, Singing Cricket looking excited)

Kayra: Oh! I bet it's something like... True Love's Kiss


(They kiss)


(Nothing happens; Singing Cricket looks worried)


(Kayra, angry, looking more monstrous as flames start to envelop Singing Cricket. Singing Cricket looks afraid.)

Kayra: OH, SO IT'S LIKE THAT, IS IT?!
