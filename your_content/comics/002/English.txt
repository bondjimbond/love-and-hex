(Kayra peering at a recipe book as a pot bubbles on the stove)

Kayra: "Cinnamon" or "cardamom"? Granny's handwriting is terrible...


(Singing Cricket enters)

Singing Cricket: Hey babe, what's cooking?

Kayra, smiling: Husband! You're just in time!


(Kayra sticks a spoon in Singing Cricket's mouth)

Kayra: Here, taste this.


(A massive POOF as Kayra shields her eyes, and a cloud envelops Singing Cricket)


(Kayra looks down at the floor, where Singing Cricket sits. He has turned into a frog.)


(Kayra turns back to the stove)

Kayra: Definitely not cardamom.

Singing Cricket, as a frog: Needs more salt.
