1. Kayra and Tamilda climbing a massive tree, with a view of the landscape stretches out ahead of them. Kayra reaches down to help Tamilda, who seems to be struggling.


2. Wearing hooded robes, Kayra holds a book and chants while Tamilda hesitantly pours a vial into a boiling cauldron. Vapour in the shape of a spirit rises up from it. They are surrounded by evil-looking shades.


3. Kayra and Tamilda (now in the form of a wolf) chase a terrified-looking boar through the forest.


4. Tamilda, now in partial-wolf form, sits with Kayra in the corpse of the boar. The two of them feast on the raw, bloody meat.


5. Tamilda (in human form again) and Kayra relax together in a mountain spring. 


6. Singing Cricket opens the door to the ladies. While Kayra kisses him on the cheek, he turns to Tamilda: "Hey, kiddo. How was your day out?"

A joyful Tamilda runs into the house with her arms outstreched. "Awesome!"


7. Singing Cricket turns to Kayra. "So what did you two do together?"

Kayra responds dismissively: "Oh, you know... Girl stuff."
