(Nanny Muk, short and horrible-looking with horns and mushrooms growing from her head, enters, followed by a tall man carrying many packages.)

Nanny: Kayra, dearie! Don't you want to see what we brought?

Kayra, off-panel: Sigh... Hi, nanny.


(Kayra sits in a chair made from a living monster. Singing Cricket, still a frog, sits in a cage beside her. The man unpacks in the background.)

Nanny: Where's your young human? He should help Calvin unpack.

Kayra: He won't be joining us.


(Calvin hangs a bundle of live snakes up on a hook. They are trying to bite him.)

Nanny, off-panel: A lover's tiff? Didn't I warn you? But young hags always think they know best...


(Close-up on Calvin's face, his expression vacant, his pupils milky. A snake has bitten his face and he has no reaction.)

Nanny, off-panel: Look at me and Calvin... Two centuries of perfect harmony. You HAVE to remove the soul, love.


(Kayra, Singing Cricket, and Nanny haven't moved. In the background, a small humanoid figure starts trying to climb out of the basket Calvin was unpacking.)

Nanny: Still, we'll miss his appetite with that big pot of stew.

Kayra: I don't feel like stew anymore.

Nanny: Oh? Then what will you make?


(Kayra, grinning, holds up a cleaver. Singing Cricket looks afraid. In background, Calvin goes after the small man with a club.)

Kayra: Frog's legs.
