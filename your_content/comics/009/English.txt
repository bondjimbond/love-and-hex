(Singing Cricket and Kayra lounge together atop a unicorn, treating it as if it were a couch. Singing Cricket peers out the window as a loud "BOOM CRASH BOOM" blasts through the house.

Singing Cricket: What's going on out there?

Kayra, smiling: It's granny!


(Outside, Singing Cricket, Kayra, and the unicorn leave Nanny Muk's house. Standing outside is Granny Dismal, carrying a large bag and a thin stick. Broken tree limbs and uprooted trees surround her. Dominating the scene is a massive set of chicken feet, their owner far off-panel. Kayra runs toward Granny.)

Kayra: Granny! How was the soul market?


(Kayra hugs Granny, who stands stiffly. The owner of those chicken feet is Granny Dismal's house, which is now wandering off on its own, uprooting more trees with its massive talons.)

Granny: Disappointing. I never even got there.

Kayra: Why not?


(Flashback, night, mountain landscape. Granny's house is walking, crossing paths with a smaller house on eagle's feet, decorated with hunting trophies. They look as if they're staring at each other.

Granny (off-panel): We stopped outside a gnomish village, just to top up the bag... When we ran into a druid's hunting lodge travelling in the other direction:

Granny's house: !

Hunting lodge: (heart symbol)


(Back to present, Granny's house has stuffed itself with trees and branches, and is clutching a log in its talons.)

Granny (off-panel): I thought the house was warmer than usual...


(A large uprooted tree, thrown by the house, sails over Kayra and Granny. Kayra ducks, Granny does not react.)

Granny: I was inside at the time. Not an experience I'd care to repeat.

Kayra: Granny! Why is your house behaving so strangely?


(The house's chicken feet are standing in the centre of an enormous nest that it has built of fallen trees, branches, etc. Granny hits one of the feet sternly with her stick.)

SFX: WHACK

Granny: Because she's been a very naughty girl!
