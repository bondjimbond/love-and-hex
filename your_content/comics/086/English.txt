1. Charlie the owlbear looms over Bill and the dwarf, ready to attack. Bill is unconscious, having hit his head on a rock. The dwarf, with a panicked look, tries to revive him. Singing Cricket approaches from behind, angrily waving a fingerl "Bad owlbear! Off!"


2. As Charlie looms over the dwarf, Singing Cricket's arms are a blur as he strikes Charlie in several spots.


3. Charlie is stuck in the same position as the previous panel, while Singing Cricket directs the dwarf away.

Dwarf: "Ye've STUNNED him!"

Singing Cricket, smiling: "Pressure points. Ought to hold him for a few--"


4. Charlie shoves the dwarf aside and growls at Singing Cricket.

Singing Cricket, teeth clenched: "...Minutes? *gulp*


5. Form off-panel, an enormous chicken leg flies out and kicks Charlie in the head with a SMACK! The dwarf ducks, and Singing cricket leaps out of the way.


6. The dwarf has collapsed on top of Bill. Singing Cricket, oh hands and knees, rubs his head. Meanwhile, Charlie is staring at Dojo's chicken legs and thinking of a delicious meal.


7. With a "RRRARH!" Charlie raises his forelegs to attack. DOjo leans into an attack stance. Singing Cricket, worried, calls out, "Dojo! Nooo!"
