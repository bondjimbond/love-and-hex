1. Singing Cricket looks through the potion shelf, the tentacle spill wrapping around his leg, while Alond, in a battered helmet with broken spear, shouts at the imp in panic. "Where is regis?! Imp! You had ONE JOB!" The imp is not having any of this nonsense.


2. The trio continue to search, when a voice comes from the next room: "Hello? Is anyone there?"


3. Singing Cricket enters the room to find the summoning circle, and an image of the tiefling woman's head floating above it - holding the missing baby. He recognizes her. "Hi, Verity! How's Hell?"

Verity: "Singing Cricket! Is this YOURS?"

From Hell, beyond the image of Verity and the baby, screams of a tortured soul echo: "AIEEE! AUGH! HEELLLP!"

Verity: "Sigh... Excuse me a moment."


4. Scene shifts to Hell. Verity glares at a spiny devil, who is extracting teeth from a man chained to a rock. An image of Singing Cricket's head floats in a flaming brazier.

Verity: "Knock it off! I'm on a call."

The spiny devil look abashed. "Sorry, Lady Verity."

"'Owwy," echoes the torture victim with pliers in his mouth.

Singing Cricket: "No, he's your brother's! I guess that makes him your nephew?"


5. Back to Nanny's house. Verity looks shocked. "Alond's son?! ..Wait - are you at the HAGS' HOUSE?"

Singing Cricket cracks an embarrassed smile. "Yeah... I knd of live here now. With Kayra. So... Can you send him BACK?"


6. Back in Hell. The spiny devil readies some sharp torture devices and grins menacingly. In the background, a boiling lake of lava and more fiendish tortures. Verity holds the happy baby in her arms, looking at him seriously.

Verity: "...  I think he may be better off here."
