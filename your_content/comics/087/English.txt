1. Singing Cricket stands between Dojo the house and Charlie the owlbear. He shouts, "DOWN, Charlie! Dojo is NOT a snack!"


2. Charlie, thinking Dojo is a delicious chicken that he wants to eat, swipes a claw at Singing Cricket. He is knocked aside.


3. The owlbear and the house launch themselves at one another.


4. Dojo's foot connects with Charlie's head with a CLONK. Charlie is stunned.


5. A confused Charlie looks again at Dojo, this time focusing on the feathers that surround the house's foundation. Singing Cricket, rubbing his injured head, struggles to get up, shouting "Stop! Leave him--"


6. Singing Cricket pauses. Instead of attacking, Charlie, still dizzy, is rubbing up affectionately against the juvenile house. He is thinking about himself as a baby owlbear, being cradled in his mother's feathery arms. Singing Cricket scratches his head as he hesitantly finishes his sentence: "... alone?"
