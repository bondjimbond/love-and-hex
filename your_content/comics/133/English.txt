1. Granny Dismal and Changeling Kayra in coversation. Granny, throwing up her hand with a defeated expression on her face, whips out a gnarled wand. Changeling looks worried.

Granny: "So there won't be any killing? Oh dear, I can see we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come here, girl."

Changeling: "Granny? What are you--"


2. Stars and sparkles descend from Granny's wand. The Changeling (still naked) looks like human Kayra again. Tamilda rushes in from off-panel to bring her her dress.

Changeling: "Oh! I look like HER again. But... it's still just an illusion. How long will it last?"

Tamilda: "Kayra, your dress!"

Granny: "As long as necessary."


3. The Changeling embraces Granny, who doesn't know how to respond to a hug.

Changeling: "Oh, Granny Dismal, you're like my fairy godmother! How can I ever thank you?"

Granny, awkwardly: "You... will invite me to the wedding. And... get some of those prawn cocktail things for the reception."


4. The Changeling embraces the whole group (Granny Dismal, real-Kayra, Tamilda), beaming.

Changeling: "Of course! I want ALL of you there!"

Granny: "Just one more thing..."


5. A close-up on Granny's face, pointing ominously. Her text is white-on-black for this panel.

Granny: "The party must NOT go on past the twelfth stroke of midnight."


6. Changeling Kayra, taken aback: "Oh! Um... Why?"


7. Granny walks away, leaving Changeling Kayra nonplussed.

Granny: "Pah! Even young people need a good night's sleep!"
