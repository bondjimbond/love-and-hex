1. Changeling Kayra grabs Real Kayra in a hug. Tamilda looks away apologetically.

Changeling: "Thank you for everything!"

Tamilda: "Sorry about... y'know, exposing you."


2. Changeling Kayra leans down and gives Tamilda a squeeze. She smiles sheepishly. Kayra claps her hands, a big grin on her face.

Changeling: "I'm glad you did! Now I know where I came from. And that I have a SISTER!"

Kayra: "Yay!"


3. Outside, the Changeling waves to the girls. Behind them, Singing Cricket falls upside-down out of a portal, a horned demon skull on his head.

Changeling: "I have to go, mother will be frantic by now. See you at the wedding!"

Kayra (small text): "Do you think she'll tell him she's made of sticks?"

Tamilda (small text): "Hopefully BEFORE the wedding."

Singing Cricket: "Waugh!"


4. Singing Cricket pulls a surprised Kayra into a passionate embrace, while discarding the huge demon skull.

Kayra: "Oh! Husband, you're back--Mmm!"

Singing Cricket: "Kayra! I missed you so much!"


5. Kayra smiles at Singing Cricket, sitll wrapped in his arms. Singing Cricket looks shocked.

Kayra: "That's sweet. I missed you too! But you've only been gone for an hour."

Singing Cricket: "An HOUR? I've been trying to get home for TWO MONTHS!"

Kayra: "Two months?? Wow!"


6. Kayra hugs Singing Cricket lovingly. Little hearts float in the air. Singing Cricket just looks nonplussed.

Kayra: "The last person who offended Granny Dismal was lost for two CENTURIES. She must really like you!"
