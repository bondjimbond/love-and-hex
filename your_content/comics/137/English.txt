This one's in colour. It's a rare treat - don't get used to it!

1. Kayra, disguised as a cute, red-skinned, short-haired tiefling, leans over the counter of her potion stall. An elderly woman with a wrinkled face hands over a pouch of gold and clutches a jar of cream.

Old woman: "Thank you, dear. I've waited so long for a refill of this wonderful wrinkle cream!"
Kayra: "Not that you need it!"
Old woman: "You're sweet. Keep the change!"

2. Kayra steps away from her illusion, leaving it behind and looking like her normal green-skinned, pointy-toothed self. and holds up the pouch of coins. Singing Cricket is impressed.

Singing Cricket: "Wow! Fifty gold pieces for wrinkle cream?"
Kayra: "Yeah! It's very popular, too. I feel bad selling it, though."

3. Singing Cricket is puzzled. Kayra looks ambivalently at the pouch of gold.

Singing Cricket: "Oh? Why's that?"
Kayra: "(sigh...) To be honest... It doesn't actually WORK."

4. Kayra looks at Singing Cricket intensely, framing her face with her hands.

Kayra: "I've been using it for months, and look -- not ONE WRINKLE!"
Singing Cricket falls over with a "plop".
