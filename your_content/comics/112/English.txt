1. Singing Cricket lounges in his slime chair, reading a book. His chair extends a pseudopod with an eyeball on the end of it over his shoulder, also reading. Kayra comes over and hands him a drink: a cocktail in a highball glass, garnished with a tall, skinny mushroom and a wedge of some kind of citrus. She gives him a kiss on his bald head.

Singing Cricket, reaching for the glass: "Thanks, babe."


2. Singing Cricket leans back, looking relaxed and contented holding his cocktail. He leaves the book on his lap. His chair extends a pseudopod to lift up the book and continues to read.

Singing Cricket: "Ah! This is nice... I just wish I had a SANDWICH to go with it."


3. Singing Cricket gasps in surprise as, with a POOF, a sandwich appears in his hand.

Singing Cricket, mouth agape: "What the--?!"


4. Singing Cricket sniffs the sandwich.

Singing Cricket: "A little bland... I wish I'd asked for mustard."


5. He grins with excitement as a squeeze tube of "HOT (sexy) MUSTARD" appears in his hand. The chair holds his drink for him.

Singing Cricket: "Whoa!"


6. A small inset panel of Singing Cricket whistling, as he begins pouring mustard on his sandwich.


7. Singing Cricket shouts "Ack!" as the wrong end of the tube breaks under the pressure of his squeeze, sending mustard into his eyes. Meanwhile, a snake slithers out from between the two slices of bread.


8. The snake bites Singing Cricket on the hand. He stares at it, horrified.

Singing Cricket: "Kayra! What's going on??"


9: Kayra sits in her mouth-chair, reading calmly and sipping from an identical glass. Singing Cricket is struggling to pull the snake off his hand. Meanwhile, the slime-chair continues to read his book while holding the cocktail.

Kayra: "What did you expect, making all those silly wishes?"

Singing Cricket: "Wishes??"

Kayra: "You did ASK fora djinn and tonic..."
