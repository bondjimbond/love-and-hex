1. Kayra is dressed in a hooded robe. She and the imp sit around a magic circle, covered in runes and candles, with a plate in its centre. She holds up a twisted dagger and a small dinosaur, as she and the imp recite some infernal ritual. (If you wanted to translate it from the Klingon script that is used in place of Infernal language, you could.)

Singing Cricket (off-panel): "Honey?"

2. Kayra looks toward singing Cricket as she goes to slit the trhoat of the little dinosaur. The imp continues the recitation off-panel.

Kayra: "Husband! Where have you been all day?"

Singing Cricket: "Well... you know how you wanted me to spend time with Granny?"

3. The room goes dark. Kayra holds the sacrifice above her head, and it bursts into flame. The imp continues his recitation. A blurry form starts to take shape in the middle 

Singing Cricket: "She asked me to help her with her potions today..."

Kayra: "That's great! I KNEW she liked you!"

4. Kayra pats the imp on his head. He claps excitedly, having just successfully summoned a sandwich from Hell.

Singing Cricket: "Right... well, something went wrong."

5. Singing Cricket enters. He has been transformed: his ears are enormous, he has sprouted hair, and his nose has turned into a long elephantine trunk. Kayra covers her mouth in astonishment.

Singing Cricket: "... Can you fix it?"

6. Kayra blushes as she strokes the trunk. Hearts float above her.

Karya: "In the morning."
