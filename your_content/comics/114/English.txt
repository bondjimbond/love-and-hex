1. Singing Cricket is lounging on his slime/chair, reading a book. Granny Dismal is reading on a stool in the background, next to the fire. A monstrous tree is chained up in the corner, with numerous wrapped gifts below it. Kayra comes in and sits on the edge of Singing Cricket's chair, dressed in a festive, fur-trimmed outfit.

Singing Cricket: "Hey, babe. Why are you dressed like a gnome?"

Kayra: "Because it's time for solstice gifts!"


2. Close-up of the monstrous tree. A large gift tagged "Husband" sits prominently beneath it. Some other gifts are there too, including a teddy bear addressed to Charlie, and a bound and gagged fairy for Nanny.

Kayra (off-panel): "Open mine first!"


3. Singing Cricket eagerly approaches the gift by the tree marked "Husband". Kayra stands in the background, looking a bit nonplussed, her hands behind her back.

Singing Cricket: "All right! Thanks, hon."


4. As Singing Cricket goes to open the gift, Kayra looks down at what she's holding: a small, wrapped gift, also tagged "Husband".

Singing Cricket, off-panel: "Ooh, it's big! ..And... sticky?"


5. The gift comes to life, its lid opening, revealing long, pointed teeth and a huge drooling tongue. The ribbons extend like tentacles and wrap up the hapless Singing Cricket.

Singing Cricket: "Kayra, what's this -- AAARGH!"


6. Off-panel, Singing Cricket struggles with the gift. Bits of wrapping and ribbon, as well as his slipper, fly into the panel from their fight. Granny stands next to Kayra, the two of them watching the struggle.

Granny Dismal: "Oh! That one's from me."
