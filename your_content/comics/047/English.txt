Singing Cricket's new students, a large musclebound human and a thick-bearded dwarf, both dressed in martial arts training uniforms with bald or shaved scalps, balance on one foot atop posts while drinking from wine bottles. More empty bottles are scattered on the ground. Singing Cricket gazes up approvingly at them.

SC: "You're getting close! Have another bottle!"

Kayra, in her Hug Your Hag apron, carries a tray of lemonade with three glasses.

K: "Break time, boys! I brought lemonade!"


Kayra and Singing Cricket hold each other affectionately while watching the students get their lemonade.

K: "How's training going?"

SC: "Pretty good!"

Dwarf: "Finally, something without BOOZE in it!"


The students drink, evidently enjoying it. Singing Cricket pours a glass for himself.

SC: "You know... after defeating Alond and stopping the war, I didn't really know what my PURPOSE was anymore... I think it's THIS."

K: "I'm so proud of you, husband! You're a great teacher!"


The students go back for more lemonade. For some reason, the dwarf and the big guy are now the same height.

SC: "Lemonade is a good idea. They need to hydrate."

SC: "Is that a new soul bag?"

K: "I made it myself!"

Singing Cricket sniffs his glass.

SC: "This smells nice. What's in it?"


Kayra looks up, thinking. 

K: "You know, normal things... Lemons, sugar... Oh! And some herbs Nanny Muk gave me.."

Singing Cricket grits his teeth with an "URK!"


Singing Cricket, grinning and perspiring, puts his glass back on the table. Kayra glares at him.

SC: "On second thought, I'll stick with wine."

The dwarf, now nearly twice as big as Singing Cricket, looms over him. The musclebound student, as short of the table, strains for the lemonade pitcher.

Dwarf: "Have ye got any more?"
