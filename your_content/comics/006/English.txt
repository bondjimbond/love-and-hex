(Kayra, staring at mirror. There are two mirrors, and two reflections stare back, but the second one is a bit different from the first. Nanny stands nearby and Singing Cricket, still a frog, sits on the dresser.)

Kayra: Am I really that ugly? I mean, my skin is smooth, my figure is trim, I don't have horns or fungus...

Singing Cricket: That's right! What does a spell know about beauty?


(Kayra turns, worried, to Nanny Muk. Her strange reflection raises its arms as if to grab her. Singing Cricket looks at Nanny Muk in shock/disgust.)

Kayra: ...But I'll grow into it, won't I?

Nanny: Yes, dearie, one day you'll be nearly as beautiful as me.


Nanny: But the curse works by HUMAN standards.

Kayra (snaps her fingers, smoke starts to billow around her. The horrible reflection shields its eyes): Oh!  ...Ugh. OK, FINE...

Singing Cricket: Um, when you say you'll grow into it...


(Smoke billows in background, and in Kayra's place stands a beautiful girl with curly blonde hair. Singing Cricket stars at her, slack-jawed.)

Singing Cricket: How long are we -- Um...


(They kiss, surrounded by stars.)


(Singing Cricket is human again. He stares at the transformed Kayra.)

Kayra: It worked! Oh, husband, I hope you aren't upset. Let me just change back, and we'll --  -- Husband?


(Singing Cricket tackles her. Her arms and legs flail in the air.)

Kayra: OOF!


(Nanny Muk and the reflection share some popcorn, looking down at Singing Cricket and Kayra off-panel.)

Kayra (off-panel): OOH! .. Well, I suppose -- Mmm... -- I could stay like this a BIT longer...
