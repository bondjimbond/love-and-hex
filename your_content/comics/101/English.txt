1. Nanny Muk sews Tamilda's clothes, adjusting them to her size. Tamilda looks happy.

Tamilda: "Thatnks for taking in my dress, Nanny."

Nanny: "Of course, dearie. Seeing you wearing it brings back sweet memories."


2. Tamilda turns to look at Nanny as Nanny bites the thread to break it. Kayra is sitting at the table with them, holding a cup of tea.

Tamilda: "Memories?"

Kayra: "Oh, I wore that all the time, back when I was HUMAN."


3. Tamilda, shocked, stands up and leans over at Kayra.

Tamilda: "You used to be HUMAN?!"

Kayra, amused: "Of course! Did you think Nanny MADE me out of GINGERBREAD?"

Meanwhile, Nanny Muk is reaching for a slice of pie, which is being brought to her by a complicated mechanism piloted by ants and beetles working together.


4. Tamilda shrugs. 

Tamilda: "Well, no... I assumed she, you know... gave BIRTH to you."

Nanny Muk, dropping the entire slice of pie into her gaping mouth: "And ruin my figure?!"


5. Singing Cricket enters, holding a large glass and a liquor bottle. He looks puzzled.

Singing Cricket: "What? Kayra was human?? Since when?"

Kayra, looking annoyed: "I was human when we MET!"


6. Singing Cricket looking thoughtful. "Really! Hmm..."


7. Close-up of Singing Cricket filling his large glass with strong liquor."

Singing Cricket: "Why don't I remember that?"

Inset: small image of Tamilda and Kayra rolling their eyes at each other.
