1. Kayra and Granny Dismal are preparing dinner, when Singing Cricket walks into the house holding an axe. "It's done." Upset, Kayra replies, "You mean -- you actually KILLED it??"


2. Singing Cricket grins nervously while Granny inspects the axe. Quietly she mutters to herself, "Hmm, no blood..." Then louder, says, "A clean kill. Perhaps I misjudged you."


3. Kayra is angry, though she's still bringing Singing Cricket a plate. "Maybe I misjudged you! How could you DO that to an innocent baby house?!" Singing Cricket, standing between two powerful women, is having trouble. "Well... It's like Granny said. It's small and weak. It can't stay here."


4. Kayra crosses her arms in anger. "You do NOT sound like the man I married." Singing Cricket, looking down at his dinner, thoughtlessly says, "You know, we aren't actually married..."


5. Kayra's hair flies up and she bares her pointy teeth. Singing Cricket srhinks in terror. "WELL KEEP IT UP, AND IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN!" she yells.


6. Cut to the woods, late at night. Singing Cricket sits by a campfire with his plate of food, eating. He passes the plate to the figure next to him -- the baby house.
