1. Nanny Muk leads toddler Kayra into the woods, away from her mother. In the background, Granny Dismal puts the finishing touches on the changeling that will replace her.

Nanny Muk: "So, dearie -- would you like to come live with your old Nanny Muk and Granny Dismal? To learn magic and become a powerful witch?"

Little Kayra: "Can I turn boys inta frogs?"


2. Kayra and Nanny walk into the background. In the foreground, Granny Dismal puts the little glowing soul into the changeling body, and enchants it to look like little Kayra.

Nanny Muk: "All you can eat."

Little Kayra: "Yay!"

Granny Dismal, to the changeling: "Time to wake up, little one. Your new life awaits."


3. Back to the present, inside Dojo. The background is full of martial arts equipment and inspirational slogans. Sitting around a little table are Granny Dismal, Singing Cricket, Kayra, the Changeling, and Tamilda. The imp carries a cake. 

Grinning, Singing Cricket slaps Granny on the back: "Ha! I knew it, granny! Under that cold, scary façada... you really are a kindhearted old softy, aren't you?"


4. Granny waves a hand at Singing Cricket, sending him into a flaming portal. He looks... concerned. Kayra watches impassively.

Granny (in Infernal script): "Go to Hell."

Singing Cricket: "Whoa, hey--"


5. The portal blinks out of existence. Singing Cricket is gone. The remaining party look at it in silence while Granny sips her tea.


6. Granny gestures to the imp. 

Granny: "Another cup, if you don't mind."
