A young girl (Tamilda), about 12, wakes up groggy and feeling sick. "Ugh, my head..." she says, hands on her face.

Her stomach gurgles: "GURRRP"

And she vomits into a chamber pot.

"Gods, what did I EAT?" she says to herself, touching the mirror. Some dark smudges on her cheeks and fingertips.

She looks at her hand, which appears to be covered in blood. "Wait... what's this?" Blood stains her face and the mirror's surface as well.

"AAAAAHHH!" she screams, staring at her bloody hands. The shot pans out to the bedoornm, where bloodstains are on the sheets and bloody handprints on the walls.


Later...

Squat, her goblin friend wearing a chef's hat, offers her a plate with some sort of weird amphibian on it. "You don't want breakfast? Are you sick?"

Tamila: "I'm not sure... I've never felt like this before."

From the soul bag on the table, the disembodied voice of her friend Baeric: "Magic, then? Some sort of curse?"


In the background a young dragon wakes up from under a pile of gold.

From the same bag, the soul of Baeric's girlfriend Kipo, says, "Oh, honey, I think it's just--"

Interrupting, an angry Tamilda slams the table with her first, frightening Squat. "A curse... Of course! I KNEW escaping the hags was too easy!"


Tamilda, now in full armour, sheathes her sword as she exits the house, her dragon following behind. "Come on, dragon... We're going on a WITCH HUNT."
