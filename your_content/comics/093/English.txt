1. Caption: a piece of paper headed "Women I Know (who aren't dead)". The first entry is "Kipo", crossed off (dead). The second is "Cirra - Druid - wolf form! Something in common?"

Tamilda stands in front of a very small house. A gnome woman with goggles on her head and a dress with pockets - Cirra - grabs her hand and excitedly leads her inside.

Cirra: "Tamilda! I'm so glad you reached out! Come in! Come in!"


2. Tamilda ducks inside. The ceiling is very low. A framed portrait of Cirra with her old adventuring friends - Baeric, Belavor, and Singing Cricket - sits on a shelf. Cirra excitedly babbles as she drags Tamilda in.

Cirra: "I've been worried sick about you living on your own! You're so skinny - are you eating properly? Let me cook you something."

Tamilda glares in annoyance. "Cirra, that's not why I'm here!"


3. The pair sit at a small table with a tea setting laid out.

Tamilda continues, looking embarrassed. "I'm just looking for... ...a friend."

Cirra is incredibly happy to hear this. "And you came to ME?? Oh, Tamilda - I'm HONOURED!"


4. Tamilda starts getting up to leave. "This was a mistake."

Cirra grabs her by the arm. "Don't go! I'm a great girlfriend! Let me try again."


5. Cirra grins and raises an eyebrow. "Sooo... Have you met any BOYS you like?"

Tamilda grits her teeth and puts her face in her palm. Cirra keeps going: "Girls? Elves?"


6. Tamilda, defeated, leaves. Cirra exits the house, chasing after her, shouting, "I can help! I'm VERY experienced! Wait! I made you this list of good schools--"

Caption: The same "Women I Know (who aren't dead)" scrap of paper, but Cirra's name is crossed out.
