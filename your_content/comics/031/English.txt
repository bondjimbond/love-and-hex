1. Singing Cricket leans over a plate of sausages and glares at Nanny Muk. "Nanny... What... Did you do... With the baby?"

Nanny, eyes wide, gestures behind her. "Oh, you don't want to go in there..."


2. Singing Cricket breaks through a door with a CRASH. Inside this room is the baby -- in a crib, with a bit stuffed owlbear in the corner. The crash wakes the baby and he starts to cry.


3. Nanny picks up the baby and glowers at Singing Cricket. "I was GOING to say he's ASLEEP." The baby is still teary-eyed and sobbing.

Singing Cricket blushes in embarrassment. "Sorry."


4. Nanny smiles down at the baby with her horrible sharp teeth and tickles him. The baby giggles in delight. "Hush, dearie. Who's my good wittle poopsie-woopsie? YOU are!"

Singing Cricket smiles. "I've never seen this side of you, Nanny!"


5. The baby smiles as Nanny tickles his toes. "Look at his sweet little TOES! Ooh, I could just eat them UP!"


6. Singing Cricket looks at her with his eyes narrowed. "...But ...You won't, right?"

Nanny looks up at him with a grin. "Ohh... Just one or two?"
