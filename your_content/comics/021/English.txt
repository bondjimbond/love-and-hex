1. At first glance, it looks like twelve-year-old Tamilda is tied to a chair, but she is in fact being held by a large hand rising up from the floor. She is surrounded by the hag coven: Kayra, Nanny Muk, and Granny Dismal. Kayra still has a sword stuck through her belly.

Granny: "What shall we do with it? It's too skinny to eat."

2. Singing Cricket enters the room, stretching his arms and yawning. "-YAWN- Good morning, ladies. Hi, Tamilda."

3. He whistles as he pours a cup of coffie.

4. He turns his head in surprise. The coffee runs over the cup and his hand. "Wait--Tamilda??"

5. Kayra waves excitedly. "Good morning, husband! Look, I found a human child!" Tamilda's eyes go wide in shock. "Husband?!" Meanwhile, Nanny Muk inspects the girl's hand, and says to herself, It looks gamey, but if we fatten it up for a few months..."

6. Kayra says, "Couldn't we keep her? I've always wanted a sister." Granny replies, "No, it's far too old to convert." Singing Cricket winces as Nanny Muk tastes Tamilda by licking her with her long, horrible tongue. "Help me," whispers Tamilda through clenched teeth.

7. Granny and Kayra continue their discussion: "Just turn it into a squirrel and let the wolves handle it," says Granny. "Or a badger!" replies Kayra. "She'd be an adorable badger!" Singing Cricket has an idea.

8. With a smile on his face, he says to the assembled coven, "You should just kill her." Tamilda's jaw drops.

9. Tamilda glares angrily at Singing Cricket.

10. Singing Cricket winks at her and gives a thumbs-up.
