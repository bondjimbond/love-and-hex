1. Singing Cricket and Kayra lounging together on top of a unicorn. Kayra is resting her head on his chest affectionately. Singing Cricket, however, is looking deeply uncomfortable. The unicorn, too, looks surprised.

Kayra: "Tamilda was so sweet! Wouldn't it be nice to have a child of our own?"

Singing Cricket: "Urk!"


2. Singing Cricket sweats as he tries to maneuver around this thorny topic. Kayra frowns. The unicorn rolls its eyes.

Singing Cricket: "Sure, eventually... but, well, it's only been a couple of months..."


3. Kayra looks up sadly at Singing Cricket. They take each other's hands.

Kayra: "But you love me, don't you, husband?"

Singing Cricket: "Of course! It's just... I'm not ready yet."


4. Singing Cricket takes Kayra in his arms.

Singing Cricket: "I JUST left the monastery, and you're just STARTING your... um... career. We have so much time ahead of us. (You're going to live basically forever, right?) We'll figure it out together."

Kayra looks happy.


5. Kayra smiles up at Singing Cricket. He smiles back. "You're right, husband. We don't need to rush... I'll be ready when you are."

She continues. "So in that case..."


6. Where she got it from we don't know, but Kayra pulls out a tiny diaper-clad human baby. "I guess I should return this?"

The baby looks at Singing Cricket and says, "Buh?"

Singing Cricket is shocked and speechless.
