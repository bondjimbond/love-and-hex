1. Singing Cricket approaches Alond, who is leaving the baby's room. He shushes him as he closes the door.

Singing Cricket: "So the baby's finally asleep?"

Alond: "His Highness PRINCE REGIS is asleep, yes. And now we can talk."

2. Alond gets an evil, scheming grin on his face. Singing Cricket is not amused.

Alond: "Here's the plan. I may have been usurped by Crispin the pretender..."

Singing Cricket, interrupting: "Son of the king your father murdered."

Alond: "Whatever."

3. Alond imagines Crispin dead, his crown lying next to him and a spilled goblet of wine.

Alond: "But let's say he has an ... unfortunate ACCIDENT. These are easily arranged."

4. Alond imagines baby Regis on the thone, crown to big for his head, Alond standing nex to the throne with a grin on his face.

Alond: "With no heir, the kingdom in chaos -- until the last scion of the noble house Summercourt appears! And who better to serve as regent for the young king... than his own FATHER?"

5. Scene shifts to Tamilda's home. She is surrounded by treasure. A baby dragon sits on a heap of gold while Tamilda throws coins at Squat. The men speak in captions.

Singing Cricket: "You'd have to escape Granny Dismal first."

Alond: "NOT a problem. I have an AGENT - powerful and well-funded - working tirelessly to DESTROY the coven."

Tamilda: "Money fight!"

Squat: "Ack! The diamonds are SHARP!"

Alond: "I'll be free ANY DAY now."

6. Singing Cricket looks annoyed with Alond. Alond responds angrily.

Singing Cricket: "Why are you telling me this? Even if it works, I WILL have to stop you."

Alond: "I know that!"

7. Alond looks a bit pathetic.

Alond: "But there's no one ELSE who'll listen to me monologue!"
