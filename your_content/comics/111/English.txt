1. A colourful Fall forest scene. Tamilda and Kayra are chatting, preparing for a walk in the woods. Tamilda wears a denim jacket and an orange scarf over her dress. Kayra is wearing a purple turtleneck sweater. Singing Cricket approaches them, wearing his usual martial arts outfit, with a grey scarf. He hands them red mugs.

Singing Cricket: "That's a hot chocolate for Tamilda, and two mulled ciders for us."

Kayra: "Thank you, husband."


2. The trio walk through the forest. Singing Cricket surreptitiously pours a flask into his mug as the women talk.

Tamilda, looking around and above her: "Your woods are so nice in the fall! The changing leaves, the birds migrating, the trees are less aggressive... I love it!"

Kayra, shivering: "Me too! But I DON'T love how CHILLY it gets."


3. Tamilda narrows her eyes at Kayra while taking a sip of her hot chocolate.

Tamilda: "You COULD try dressing more appropriately for the WEATHER."

Kayra: "But this is my WARMEST sweater!"


4. Low angle shot focusing on the characters' legs. 

Tamilda: "That's not quite what I meant--"

Singing Cricket's speech balloon passes behind Kayra's bare legs, her sweater only coming down just past her butt: "Hush -- don't ruin it."
