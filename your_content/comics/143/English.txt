1. Tamilda enters the hags' house with a big grin, her dress and boots covered in mud. She tracks mud onto the floor. Singing Cricket is cuddled up with Kayra on the back of a unicorn, reading a book with an anarchy symbol on the cover. Nearby, an ant and beetle are doing the same on the back of a rhinoceros beetle. Behind them, a sinister shadowy figure peers in at the window, unnoticed.

Tamilda: "Sorry I'm late!"

Singing Cricket: "Hey, Tamild! ...Are you all right?"


2. Tamilda holds up her muddy dress to inspect it.

Tamilda: "What do you mean?"

Singing Cricket: "You're looking kind of rough."

Tamilda: "Oh! Yeah, I had to stop in a swamp for directions."


3. Tamilda sits down at the table with Singing Cricket, as Kayra cuts her a slice from a gelatinous cube. Inside the cube are some odds and ends, including the armoured skeleton of a mouselike creature. Tamilda seems eager for the meal.

Kayra: "Do you want to change?"

Tamilda: "Huh? Into what?"

Singing Cricket: "You didn't bring any other clothes?"


4. Tamilda rolls her eyes as she chews.

Tamilda: "Come on, Singing Cricket. We're going to a WEDDING. Obviously I'm gonna wear a DRESS."

Singing Cricket: "Sure, but maybe a different dress than the one you just trudged through a SWAMP in?"


5. Kayra puts her hand on Tamilda's shoulder, expressing concern. Tamilda looks annoyed. Singing Cricket rubs his chin thoughtfully. Unnoticed, the gelatinous cube slips away.

Kayra: "Sweetie... Do you HAVE any other dresses?"

Tamilda: "Why would anyone need more than ONE dress?"

Singing Cricket: "Come to think of it, since you gave Tamilda that outfit, I haven't seen her wearing ANYTHING else."


6. Tamilda and Singing Cricket hammer the table with their fists, angrily yelling at each other.

Tmailda: "Oh yeah? When's the last time YOU changed YOUR outfit?"

Singing Cricket: "That's COMPLETELY different!"
