1. The slasher from #108 was stalking through the woods, clutching his machete. His clothes are torn, and he is injured - but he hears voices and perks up. In the distance, a young couple (Singing Cricket and Kayra) are sitting on a log by a pond, watching some fiery skulls floating around.

Singing Cricket: "You were right, babe... This is pretty nice."

Kayra: "Nanny Muk used to bring me here to watch the flameskulls all the time when I was a girl."


2. Singing Cricket gets up, not noticing that the slasher is standing behind him with his machete raised. Kayra doesn't seem to see him either.

Singing Cricket: "I'm gonna get another drink. Want anything?"

Kayra: "How about Sex in the Crypt?"


3. The slasher swings his knife at Singing Cricket, but the monk, seemingly oblivious, dodges it by bending down to take the top off a tree stump. The stump is full of bottles, and a shrugging ice mephit.

Singing Cricket: "Sorry, babe, we're out of spirits."

Kayra (off-panel): "Boo! ...Any pixies?"


4. Holding two bottles, Singing Cricket turns toward Kayra just as the slasher swings his knife again. Singing Cricket steps back, and the knife only cuts the top off of one of the bottles.

Singing Cricket: "How about a beer-- Whoops!"


5. The slasher looms over him, fingers spread, reaching for his throat. Singing Cricket is looking at his bottle, pondering.

Singing Cricket: "Hmm..."


6. The slasher lunges at Singing Cricket, but -- again, seemingly oblivious -- steps aside, and instead places the broken bottle in the slasher's hand. He turns back toward the stump, where the ice mephit is offering another bottle.

Singing Cricket: "Here, you can have this one."

Slasher: "?"


7. The slasher stalks off into the distance, frustrated. He tosses his drink behind him. Singing Cricket passes a bottle to Kayra, looking annoyed.

Singing Cricket: "Friend of yours?"

Kayra: "I thought he was here for you!"

Singing Cricket: "Rude... He didn't even stay to finish his drink!"
