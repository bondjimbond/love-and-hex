1. Alond, bruised and battered and covered in stinking, nasty muck, clutches his back and pants. He holds up a mushroom. Kayra claps her hands in delight.

Alond: "I... *gasp* got one..."

Karya: "Ooh! The last ingredient!"

2. Singing Cricket holds his nose and sticks out his tongue. Alond gestures in protest.

Singing Cricket: "Phew! What's that smell?"

Alond: "Do you know how many piles of wyvern dung I had to dig through to find that mushroom?!"

3. Singing Cricke checks in on Kayra, who is grinding the mushroom with various other ingredients, such as ogre toenail clippings, in a mortar.

Alond (off-panel): "Do you KNOW what wyverns eat?!"

Singing Cricket: "Hey babe, what are you making?"

Kayra: "Nanny Muk gave me her skin cream formula!"

4. Singing Cricket sips his drink while Kayra takes her concoction to her skull-shaped vanity.

Singing Cricket: "Skin cream? What's it for?"

Kayra: "Oh, you know. Warts, boils, wrinkles.."

5. Kayra has a glob of cream on her hands. She turns in annoyance to respond to Singing Cricket.

Singing Cricket (off-panel) "But YOU don't have any warts, boils, or wrinkles!"

Kayra: "I know..."

6. Kayra applies the cream to her nose, smiling. Singing Cricket grimaces.

Kayra: "...But I'm working on it!"
