1. The coven - Nanny Muk, Kayra, and Granny Dismal - sit on a bench outside Nanny's house, watching Singing Cricket show off Charlie's tricks. Singing Cricket points and says, "Sit!" Looking happy and friendly, Charlie sits.


2. Singing Continues with a new command: "Roll over!" Like a friendly dog, Charlie rolls over. Kayra claps. Granny Dismal says, "Impressive."


3. Nanny Muk turns to Kayra: "Though I am a BIT disappointed. I was looking forward to making sausages out of him."

Kayra replies, "You mean the OWLBEAR, right?"


4. The conversation continues as Charlie jumps through a hoop.

Nanny: "Either one's fine."

Granny Dismal: "Thank you, young man. That is enough."


5. Granny talking to Singing Cricket while he scratches Charlie's head. 

Granny: "My expectations were low, but you really did make a pet of the owlbear. How did you do it?"

Singing Cricket, about to take a drink: "I guess Charlie and I share a... unique bond."

Granny: "I am pleased to see you applying yourself with such dedication."


6. Granny continues: "...But I hope you aren't neglecting your little HOUSE."

Singing Cricket spills his drink on himself in shock, annoying Charlie.
