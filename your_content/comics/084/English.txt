1. Singing Cricket and the dwarf talk while, in the background, Bill takes Dojo through some drills. Bill goes into a dive roll.

Singing Cricket: "...And Granny Dismal wasn't buying it, so I had to PROVE I had a pet! And there was an owlbear chasing a hedgehog..."

Dwarf: "Why didn't you take the HEDGEHOG?"

Singing Cricket: "Too prickly."


2. Singing Cricket puts his arm around the dwarf and watches Dojo with pride. Dojo leaps into a dive roll as well. Bill looks on, satisfied. 

Singing Cricket: "But look at little Dojo! He's doing so well! I'd do it all again to keep him safe!"

Dwarf: "So where's this Charlie now?"


3. Scene shifts to inside Nanny Muk's cottage. In the background, Nanny and Granny are performing grotesque work on a beholder which may or may not be alive.

In captions, Singing Cricket narrates: "Kayra offered to watch him today. He's still so wild, though -- He nearly took my arm off! I hope she'll be all right.

In the foreground, Kayra sits in her living chair reading a magazine, reaching for a plate of cookies held by a hypnotized Charlie. "Thank you, Charlie."


4. Dojo kicks at Bill, who catches it. Singing Cricket, meanwhile, continues his conversation. "But thanks to Charlie, Granny still doesn't know Dojo is alive! I was a bit nervous when Alond showed up--"


5. In the background, Bill throws Dojo, who crashes into a tree.

Singing Cricket is suddenly worried. "Oh, no -- where's Alond?? If he tells Granny, we're all -"

The dwarf puts a hand on his arm and smiles. "Not tae worry, master..."


6. Scene changes to inside Dojo. Because Dojo has been thrown around, the wall is currently where the floor should be. Alond is inside, tied up, looking battered and bruised and discombobulated after Dojo's workout.

From the window, the dwarf's voice continues: "I put him somewhere safe."
