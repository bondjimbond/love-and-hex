1. Caption: "Several months earlier"

Granny Dismal lying in bed, wearing an Ebeneezer Scrooge style nightcap. Her bed is decorated with a traditional spider-and-skull motif. The furniture has sprouted buds. She yawns and says, "Why is it so hot in here?"


2. The buds blossom into flowers - female flowers, with large pistils. "Flowers? Why--" She raises her eyebrows, realizing what's happening. "Oh, no."


3. Granny ducks as a massive beam crashes through the window. The beam is covered with male flowers, and pollen dust fills the room. 


4. Wide shot. It's night, the moon is full, and there is another bird-legged house positioned behind Granny's chicken-legged hut. This house is wooden, and has a mounted owlbear head outside. A large pelt is stretched out on the roof. A male druid (looking a lot like Getafix from the Asterix books) smokes a pipe and leans out the window, looking calm and smug. Granny leans out her own window as her house is jostled. "Sir!" she shouts, shaking a fist. "Control your house!"

The druid takes a puff from his pipe and says, "He's his own person, man."


5. As the houses crash, bang, and creak, Granny ineffectually whacks her house with her cane. "Stop it! Bad girl! Off!"


6. The houses continue mating off in the background, while the focus is on a large, furry man wearing a checkered suit. He's holding a thin rod, which he speaks into. "This is Bob Bugbear, reminding you to have your home spayed or neutered."
