1. Kayra and Singing Cricket are relaxing in the house reading books, when there is a mighty CRACK from outside.

Singing Cricket: "What's that?"

Kayra: "The house eggs!"


2. Outside, Granny's chicken-legged hut is standing, towering over the people. Below it is its nest, with a single huge egg in it. Singing Cricket and Kayra are approaching - Singing Cricket curious, Kayra excited. Granny stands with her arms crossed, looking annoyed.

Singing Cricket: "So this is how houses are made! I always wondered."

Granny: "Only one egg! And such poor pedigree... My hopes are not high."


3. The egg hatches. A tiny log cabin, with a crooked thatched roof, crooked tin chimney, crooked door and window frames, and little pinfeathers sticking out of its base, struggles to stand on its oversized bird feet.

Granny, off-panel: "What's this?!"

Baby house: "Chirrp?"


4. The house falls over onto the ground with a CRASH. Kayra pats it on the roof. "Aww, it's so sweet!"

Granny, arms still crossed, glares. "Pah! It's a RUNT!"


5. As Singing Cricket and Kayra fawn over the baby house, Granny puts her head through its door. 

Granny: "Ugh, the flooring! Disgusting."

Singing Cricket: "Come on, it's cute."

Kayra: "What shall we call it?"


6. Singing Cricket glares at her and Kayra looks worried. as Granny joins them in frame, holding an axe. "Firewood."
