1. Singing Cricket sites in a slime chair, reading Good House-Keeping: The Care and Feeding of Mobile Homes.


2. He reaches for his glass of beer, and accidentally knocks it over. "Oops!"


3. To Singing Cricket's surprise, a mouth forms on the floor and slurps up the spilled ale.


4. A pseudopod extends from the table to pick up the fallen glass. The floor burps loudly: "UURRP"

Singing Cricket strokes his chin. "Huh! You like that, do you?"


5. Caption: "Later..."

Singing Cricket and the wall are laughing together. He sites on top of a barrel with its tap open, pouring beer into a mouth on the floor. The wall has a pseudopod around Singing Cricket's arm. Singing Cricket is telling a story: "...So we tell her, 'That's not your husband - that's an intellect devourer!' And she says - 'I know... I PREFER him this way!'"


6. Singing Cricket pats the wall in a friendly manner. "You know, mimic house, you're all right. Let's do this again sometime. I'm gonna hit the hay before I get in trouble. Good night!" A pseudopod in the floor lifts the barrel up to catch the last drops.


7. Caption: "Later still..."

Singing Cricket and Kayra are lyinig bed together. Kayra, eyes closed, yawns and says, "Husband, close the window."


8. Zoom out - the entire mimic house has collapsed into a drunken puddle. Mouths continue to drink from various bottles and barrels. Singing Cricket gets out of bed in a panic as Nanny Muk sites up in her bed and asks, "...Where did my house go?"
