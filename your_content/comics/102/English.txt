1. A bewildered Tamilda gestures at Kayra while Nanny Muk eats beetles. 

Tamilda: "If Kayra used to be a normal human, how did she end up like... THIS??

Kayra, blushing: "Oh, stop."


2. Flashback: a little girl wanders away from her mother, who is doing laundry by a river. Nanny Muk stands at the edge of the forest, luring her over with a big lollipop.

Nanny Muk (in captions): "You need THREE for a coven... A maiden, a mother, and... so on."

(Captions continue): "YOUNG hags are rare... so we might find a promising, unattended little girl... and take her home."


3. Tamilda, in caption: "You steal babies?!"

Kayra, in caption: "Oh, I LOVED being raised by Granny Dismal and Nanny Muk! They taught me so much!"

(Captions continue): "Cooking..."

A young human Kayra in a witch's hat, stirring a cauldron while staring intently at a cookbook with a skull on the cover titled "Soul Food".


4. Captions continue: "Herbology..."

Young human Kayra, wearing earmuffs, proudly pulls a mandrake root out of the ground. The mandrake screams, causing birds to fall dead out of the sky.


5. Captions continue: "I even had pets!"

Young human Kayra walking outside Nanny's house, hand in hand with the imp, leading a horrific monster covered in eyes and mouths (a Gibbering Mouther) on a leash. A cat watches from the background.


6. Singing Cricket smiles with relief, his hand on his chest. On the table, the imp has knocked over the insects' pie-serving contraption and is walking away with the pie dish.

Singing Cricket: "Phew! That's a relief... I'd always heard hags stole babies to EAT them!"

Nanny Muk, looking annoyed: "Ridiculous!"


7. Nanny Muk continues, grinning: "Babies are all FAT! Empty calories. They're much MEATIER at six of seven."

Tamilda stares at Nanny, horrified. Singing Cricket falls over with a PLOP.
