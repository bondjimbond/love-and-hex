1. Changeling Kayra and her mother are in the Kingsport city market, looking at goods. The changeling is looking at the wares of a mask vendor, who looks a bit like Chilchuck from Dungeon Meshi, while her mother is looking at cloth. 

Mother: "Kayra, dear, you seem distracted. What's wrong?"

Changeling: "Hm? Oh... nothing, mother."


2. Her mother takes her hand. Changeling Kayra looks a bit embarrassed.

Mother: "It's the wedding. You're having second thoughts."

Changeling: "What? No! .. I mean... Maybe? .. Sigh... How did you know?"


3. Her mother smiles at her and takes her other hand as well.

Mother: "I'm your MOTHER, sweetie. You've no secrets from me. What's the matter? Jonathan is very fond of you."

Changeling, looking worried: "I know. And I'm fond of him too! But..."


4. Changeling Kayra expresses consternation. Her mother puts a hand on her shoulder.

Changeling: "We haven't spent that much TIME together. I'm not sure he'll LIKE the... REAL ME."

Mother: "Sweetheart... You're my beautiful, talented, clever, wonderful girl. THAT is the REAL YOU."


5. Changeling Kayra looks sad. 

Changeling: "I know you believe that..."

Mother: "Darling, I GAVE BIRTH to you. I RAISED you. I see you every day. If I TELL you you're lovable, it's TRUE. After all, who knows you better than your OWN MUM?"


6. Changeling daughter puts her arm around her mother's waist and rests her head on her shoulder as they continue their walk through the market. We see the shadow of her true form -- an animate doll made of mud and sticks -- under her pretty human skin.

Changeling: "Sigh... No one, mother."
