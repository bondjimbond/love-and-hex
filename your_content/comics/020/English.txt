1. Kayra wakes up. "Husband? Did you hear something?" But Singing Cricket, lying next to her, simply snorts and continues to sleep. Tamilda can be seen charging toward the house through the window.


2. Tamilda running, sword drawn, shouting, "Singing Cricket! I'm coming!"


3. With wild eyes, Tamilda kicks the door off its hinges with a CRASH. Kayra, in her nightgown, clasps her hands and smiles. "Oh, a human child!"


4. Kayra's question to Singing Cricket ("Is it yours, husband?") is obscured by Tamilda screaming, "Die, witch!"


5. With a SHLIK she plunges her sword through Kayra's stomach, to the hilt. Blood seeps out.


6. Kayra looks down in shock at the sword in her belly. Tamilda pumps her fist, and with a victorious glare at Kayra shouts "Ha!"


7. Kayra clasps Tamilda in a hug. The child's eyes bug out as her face is squished into the night hag's breasts. Kayra beams, seemingly unaffected by the sword sticking all the way through her, as she exclaims, "She's so CUTE!"
