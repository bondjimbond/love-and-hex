1. Tamilda and Nanny Muk help Calvin out of the trunk he'd been stuck in.

Nanny Muk: "Poor dear Calvin! Let's get you out of that old trunk."

Tamilda looks distrubed.


2. Nanny holds Calvin close. Tamilda points at her soul bag.

Tamilda: "So you've kept this man's SOUL in that bag -- for 200 YEARS?"

Nanny, looking at her soul bag: "Certainly! Keeps him FRESH."


3. Tamilda, pondering.

Tamilda: "If the bag were opened... could the soul RETURN to its body?"

Nanny Muk: "It could, but nobody wants THAT."


4. Tamilda suddenly lunges for the bag around Nanny's neck, surprising her.


5. Nanny swiftly grabs Tamilda's arm before she can seize the bag.

Nanny Muk: "Don't do anything RASH, dearie..."


6. Tamilda's arms swell up and sprout hair - a partial werewolf transformation. With animal strength, she grunts, rips the bag from Nanny's neck, and shoves her away.

Tamilda: GRRRRAARGH!"


7. Tamilda opens the soul bag. Something starts to flow out of it. She looks excitedly up.

Tamilda: "Calvin, you're free!"


8. The spirit of a buff-looking young man, who looks a lot like Nanny's soul-stealing "vic-er, partner" in the previous episode, emerges from the bag, stretching. Tamilda looks confused; Nanny crosses her arms in annoyance.

Calvin's soul: "*YAWWN* .. Is it time to come out again already, my love? I'm still tired from our holiday..."
