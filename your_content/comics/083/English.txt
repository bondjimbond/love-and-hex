1. Singing Cricket, bruised, battered, and missing one sleeve, approaches his students (the dwarf, the big guy, and Dojo) as they are training together.

Dwarf: "Master! Where have ye been? We thought the crone had caught you!"

Singing Cricket, tired: "Not yet! (Yawn) I've just been busy with Charlie. But I haven't forgotten you!"


2. Singing Cricket gets down into plank position. The students follow suit. Dojo crashes down into position, though he has no arms. 

Singing Cricket: "Today we'll work on your core. Let's beat your PLANK RECORD!"

Dwarf: "Who's Charlie?"


3. The students are confidently holding their planks with smiles on their faces. Singing Cricket's feet are visible, leading off-panel to the rest of him.

CAPTION: "2 minutes"

Dwarf: "Ha, I'm not even breakin' a sweat!"


4. Same positions, but the students are sweating.

CAPTION: "10 minutes"

Dwarf: "All right, ye've made yer point..."


5. Same positions. Dwarf and big guy are trembling and looking worried.

CAPTION: 30 minutes

Big guy: "Maybe... it's a lesson?"

Dwarf: "He's not even SWEATIN', Bill! He isnae HUMAN!"


6. The two students are straining, gritting their teeth, and looking like they're turning to jelly. The house of course is fine.

CAPTION: "45 minutes"

Dwarf: "MASTER! We cannae take any more. WE GIVE IN!"

Singing Cricket, from off-panel: "Hm?"


7. Singing Cricket, still in plank position, yawns.

Singing Cricket: "YAWN - Sorry, I had a late night. I must've drifted off."

The dwarf and Bill (now we know the big guy's name!) open their mouths in amazement.

The house is fine, resting on its face/door.


8. Singing Cricket looks forward again, ready to get back to business. "All right! I think you can get up to FIVE MINUTES. What do you say?"

The students collapse.
