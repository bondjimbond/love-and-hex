1. Tamilda, wearing a backpack, is ready to head out the door. She turns to check on her friends.

Tamilda: "Is everyone ready to go to the city?"

Singing Cricket stands behind her, arms akimbo, wearing a big false moustache. 

Singing Cricket: "Yep! I've got my disguise right here."

Kayra stares at him, mouth agape.


2. Singing Cricket kisses Kayra's hand. She looks away, cheeks flushed, smiling shyly.

Kayra: "Oh, my, who is this handsome stranger?"

Singing Cricket: "Enchanté, my lady."

Tamilda walks away, rolling her eyes. "All right. I'll see you outside."


3. Singing Cricket grabs Kayra and dips her, giving her a big kiss. Her cheeks are flushed, her eyes remain open.


4. Enraged, Kayra shouts, "How dare you!" and slaps Singing Cricket on the cheek. His moustache flies off his face.

Kayra continues: "I'm a married woman!" 

In smaller text: "No matter HOW attractive you are!"


5. Singing Cricket lies on the floor, eyes spiralling, dizzy. His moustache lies next to him. Kayra looks down in shock: "Oh, no! Husband!"


6. She grabs Singing Cricket and holds his head tight to her chest. Angrily, she says: "Who did this to you? It was that alluring stranger, wasn't it? Don't worry, husband. I think I frightened him off."
