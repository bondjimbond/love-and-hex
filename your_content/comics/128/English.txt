1. A young pregnant woman, battered and bloody, slumped on the floor of her home. A broken chair beside her, walls splattered with blood. A horned shadow looms over her. Terrified look on her face, nevertheless she reaches desperately toward the source of the shadow.

Young woman: "Please... Help... me..."


2. A worm's eye view of an elderly woman with a stern expression, walking stick, and cloak, framed by the doorway. It's night. She looks down at the woman.

Old woman: "I can only save one of you. Who will it be?"


3. The young woman looks sadly at her belly. Blood is pooling below her.

Young woman: "If... I choose... the baby... Will it... have... (cough) A good life?"

Old woman (off-panel): "Better than she'd have here."


4. The young woman reaches toward the old one, who kneels down to look her in the eye.

Young woman: "Then save her. *cough* Give her the... life... I couldn't."

Old woman: "And what PRICE will you offer me?"


5. The young woman lifts her left hand and looks at her wedding ring.

Young woman: "Even after... this... He's still... MINE... isn't he?"

Old woman (off-panel): "Till DEATH is the usual arrangement."

Young woman: "Then I offer you... My HUSBAND."


6. The old woman's face changes, revealing her as the horned, black-eyed, razor toothed hag, Granny Dismal. She grins. But she does not notice the raised up behind her.

Granny: "Oh, you clever, CLEVER child. Yes... That will be a MOST ACCEPTABLE arrangement."
