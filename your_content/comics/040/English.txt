1. Outside Nanny Muk's house, Singing Cricket is proudly dressed in an excessively fancy outfit. He's still wearing his magical flip-flops over his stockings. Kayra has on the glamour that makes her look like a half-elf Jessica Rabbit.

Singing Cricket: "Well, how do I look?"

Kayra, clapping her hands with appreciation: "So handsome!"

The rabbit behind them rolls his eyes. Unnoticed, tentacles break through the window and door.


2. The pair fly off on a broomstick. Singing Cricket holds onto his hat.

Kayra: "You wore this outfit when we first met, remember?"

Singing Cricket: "I have absolutely no memories of that night."

Kayra: "How strange!"


3. Villagers dance around a band playing fiddle, accordion, and clarinet. A feast is laid out next to the barn. Singing Cricket and Kayra get ready to land.

Kayra: "We're here! The harvest festival!"

Singing Cricket: "I hope they have cider!"


4. While Kayra hides her broom in a bush, an old man with a corncob pipe clutching a mug of ale approaches Singing Cricket. "Ay, who's this dandy? Where'd ya git them fancy duds?"

Singing Cricket, smiling: "I bought them from some rats!"


5. The old man walks away in scorn. "I hope they take returns."

Singing Cricket looks forlornly at his fancy cap. "Babe... We may be a BIT overdressed."

Kayra: "Oh, dear... do you think so?"


6. Kayra snaps her fingers, casting a spell.


7. Kayra is now dressed more humbly, in a cute peasant outfit and slippers. Her hair is now in a ponytail. She grabs Singing Cricket, who is still dressed fancy, and drags him off to the party.

Kayra: "All right, let's go!"

Singing Cricket: "Wait! I don't know how to do that!"
