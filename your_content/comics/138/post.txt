After Che from the excellent <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/table-top/list?title_no=842302">Table Top</a> put Singing Cricket in <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/table-top/no-wrong-choices/viewer?title_no=842302&episode_no=179">one of her episodes</a>, I've been wanting to bring Nanny into one of mine. Happily Che was keen to work with me, and gave me some custom drawings of her Nanny to drop into my scene.

Given that last time Singing Cricket interacted with her *player* rather than Nanny directly, this does raise a lot of questions about how their universes interact...

Read Table Top! It's great!
