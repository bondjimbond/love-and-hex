1. In the foreground, Amanita tries to silence her tongue with a pair of scissors. The onlookers are sick with disgust. Behind her, Kayra approaches Ephemera Hatrack, who she suspects to be Regis's mother.

Kayra: "Mind if I sit with you?"

Ephemera: "Be my guest. The seat isn't exactly in demand."

Kayra: "Oh? Why not?"

Tongue: "Now let me tell you about my relationship with my parents..."

2. Ephemera folds her arms and rolls her eyes. 

Ephemera: "I'm sure Amanita told you everything you need to know about me."

Kayra: "They made you abandon your BABY. That must have been terrible!"

Off-panel: "AAARGH!" "Good Gods!"

3. Kayra and Ephemera sit down to chat. In the background, Amanita runs away, holding her hand over her mouth. Her bloody tongue follows after her. 

Ephemera: "I never wanted to be a mother... but if I bore the KING'S son -- just imagine the opportunities! And then that IDIOT got himself deposed..."

Tongue: "I put my finger on the scales when no one's looking!"

4. A flashback to Ephemera abandoning Regis under a bush.

Ephemera (in captions): "Being unmarried and pregnant was bad ENOUGH for my reputation. But when people saw that TAIL... I thought getting rid of it would help, but life here is still HELL."

5. The scene cuts to Regis in his nursery in Hell, being fed by an antlike devil nursemaid. He has toys and a crib. A portrait of his aunt Verity hangs on the wall. Outside the window, devils play volleyball with a human head. The ladies speak in captions.

Kayra: "That's too bad! He's very happy in his new home."

Ephemera: "Really??"

Kayra: "Oh, yes! Books, servants... a lake view... He's in the lap of luxury!"

6. Ephemera's eyes shine and she takes Kayra's hands. 

Ephemera: "Do you think I could join him there?"

Kayra: "Of course!"

7. They hug. Kayra's eyes and sharp teeth appear behind the woman's head.

Kayra: "I'll send you there tonight."
