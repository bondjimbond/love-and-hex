1. Singing Cricket is sitting at a table with a beer, playing a card game with Alond. Alond is pouting with his arms crossed. Kayra appears.

Kayra: "I'm off to the village, husband!"

Singing Cricket: "What's happening there?"


2. Kayra affectionately comes up behind Singing Cricket, holding his shoulders and bringing her head close to his. "It's the harvest festival! I'll be there to see what kinds of potions people need, who deserves an ironic curse... (Look for innocent souls that might fetch a good price...) But there'll be DANCING! Come with me!"


3. Camera zooms out again to show everyone present, including grumpy Alond and the imp grimacing at his tiny glass of beer.

Singing Cricket: "I'd love to, but we're trying to cheer up Alond. He's been GROUCHY since his baby went to HELL. (I think he actually MISSES the little guy.)

Alond, muttering and not fooling anyone: "I do NOT. I'm just mad because my PLANS were foiled."

Kayra, arms crossed in annoyance: "Hmph!"


4. Kayra turns away. "That's too bad. I guess I'll have to go alone. ..Whoops! I nearly forgot my makeup!" She snaps her fingers, and a magical aura forms around her hand.


5. Kayra transforms into a voluptuous woman in a low-cut, cleavage-revealing dress with a slit up to her waist. She looks like a half-elven Jessica Rabbit.


6. In this new shape, Kayra touches Singing Cricket's shoulder and blows a kiss as she walks away. "I'll be home late. Don't wait up."

He stares at hear with hearts in his eyes.


7. Singing Cricket tosses his cards aside and gets up in a panic. "I'll go find my good robes!"

Meanwhile, Alond continues to pout, not noticing the imp who has set down his small glass and is drinking Alond's larger beer with a straw.
