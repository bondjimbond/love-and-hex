1. After hearing Granny Dismal's story about her origin, the Changeling confronts her. Granny calmly sips her tea.

Changeling: "So you saved my life -- or rather, my SOUL -- but then you put me in THIS body?!"

Granny Dismal: "The words you're looking for are 'Thank you'."


2. The Changeling looks down in submission, but gestures at herself. 

Changeling: "Right... thank you. I AM grateful, truly. But... it's not easy, hiding what I am."

Granny Dismal: "Out with it, girl. Speak your piece."


3. The Changeling looks down nervously and touches her fingertips together. 

Changeling: "It's just... couldn't you have made me... You know..."

Granny Dismal, crossing her arms: "You want a HUMAN body."


4. The Changeling looks up at Granny hesitantly.

Changling: "Is that... possible??"

Granny Dismal, reaching down for her bag: "Oh, certainly. Transferring a soul from one vessel to another is a trifling matter."


5. The Changeling smiles and leans forward excitedly as Granny digs through her bag.

Changeling: "That's great! How do we get started?"

Granny: "First, you'll need to choose a suitable human body. There are plenty of options, take your pick. Here..."


6. The changeling covers her mouth in shock as Granny hands her an ornate and twisted dagger.

Granny Dismal: "You'll need this."
