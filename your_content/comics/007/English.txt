(Singing cricket walks through a dark forest, late at night, ho.ding a wineskin. A full moon looms overhead.)

Mysterious voice, off-panel: Siiinging Criiiicket...

Singing Cricket: What? That voice...


(An enormous round monster with one massive eye at the centre of its head, mouth full of thin, pointy teeth, surrounded by smaller eyes on stalks, fills the panel)

Monster: That's right... I'm back. And this time, it's YOU who dies.


(Singing Cricket runs toward the monster, clutching a dagger.)

Singing Cricket: I don't know how you did it, Graaxnaath. But I killed you once...


(Singing Cricket leaps at Graaxnaath, dagger raised. Beams of magical energy fire from the eyes on its stalks, all narrowly missing our hero.)

Singing Cricket: I can do it again!


(Singing Cricket is on top of Graaxnaath. Small eyestalks stare at him as he plunges his black dagger into the monster.)

Singing Cricket: Ha! It's over. I'm sending you back to... ...Wherever it is people go when I stab them.


(Singing Cricket stares at his arm, as black tendrils rise up from the wound -- or is it the knife? -- covering his hand and arm.)

Singing Cricket: Wait -- What's happening?

Graaxnaath: You've taken so many souls with the lich's dagger...


(Singing Cricket's body is almost entirely covered in blackness, and it twists and warps as it is sucked into the dagger's blade.)

Graaxnaath: ...Did you really believe it wouldn't claim yours?

Singing Cricket: Noooooooooo


(Blackness)

Singing Cricket, off-panel: ... Where am I?


(The blackness opens up in the shape of an eye. A wide, black mouth is revealed, filled with needle-sharp teeth.)

Singing Cricket, off-panel: AAAAH!


(Shift in perspective: Singing Cricket is lying in bed, rumpled sheets beside him. Kayra, in a nightdress, sits on top of him, her hands on his chest.)

Kayra: Good morning, husband!

Singing Cricket: Kayra? I asked you to stay out of my dreams!

Kayra: But I need the practice!
