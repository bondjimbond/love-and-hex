1. An enraged man dressed like a lumberjack enters the house, wielding a double-headed axe with blood on it and glaring at Granny Dismal. Granny, who looks like a human in the panel, looks at him impassively.

Man: "You wandered into the wrong house, old crone. Step away from MY PROPERTY."

Granny: "Your 'property'? No... I don't think I shall."


2. Granny looking small, like a worried and fragile elderly woman, staring up at the axe being swung toward her.

Granny: "Oh, dear. That axe looks very sharp."


3. From the perspective of the man. Granny's eyes turn black as she looks at him. The axe's trajectory changes mid-swing, and instead of hitting Granny it flies at his neck. Blood sprays.

Granny: "Be careful..."

Granny's speech baloon shifts from white to black: "You might HURT yourself."


4. The bloody, dying woman reaches for the hand of her decapitated husband. Granny, meanwhile, puts his head into her bag.

Woman: "It wasn't always... like this.. you know. It was... sweet.. at... first."

Granny: "It usually is."


5. The woman closes her eyes, looking content, as Granny - now fully revealed in her night hag form - extracts a glowing ball -- the baby's soul -- from the woman's swollen belly.

Granny: "Your baby is safe. Our bargain is complete. Rest now, child. You've earned it."

Woman, last of her life leaving her: "Will she.. be.. happy..?"


6: Granny leaves the house, holding the little glowing soul in one hand and her bag with the dead man's hair sticking out in the other. The transparent headless ghost of the dead husband follows her, holding the very real axe.

Granny: "That's up to her."
