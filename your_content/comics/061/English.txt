1. Tamilda, dressed for travel, is outside with her dragon. Singing Cricket, Kayra, and Granny are gathered together next to her. Nanny Muk is coming down the path toward them from the house, carrying a basket.

Tamilda: "It's time we went home. I've... learned a lot. ...Thanks."


2. Tamilda and Kayra hug. 

Kayra: "You'll come visit us again?"

Tamilda, actually looking happy this time: "Definitely."


3. Tamilda and the dragon proceed happily down the path. The dragon turns his head as Nanny Muk says, "Come now, little dragon, say goodbye."


4. Tamilda's mouth opens in surprise when the dragon, looking strained, says with a struggle, "Gud-by nah-nee."


5. Excited, Tamilda asks, "Did you learn to talk??" But the dragon shakes his head.


6. Tamilda glares. "Nanny Muk, what's going on?"


7. With a wink and finger guns, Nanny says, "Oh, I guess I just have the... MAGIC TOUCH."


8. Tamilda is weirded out by Nanny, who continues to hold this pose for much longer than seems reasonable. "... Oooh-kaaay..."

A pause.

Tamilda ends with, "... We'll just be going now."
