1. Kayra, looking worried, cuts her way through the dense forest using her claws like machetes. She wades through a horrible-looking bramble patch. "Husband, where ARE you? Not that I care, but, um... The IMP misses you."


2. From off-panel, a THUD and a BANG. "Ouch! Let us out!" Kayra gasps. "Husband! I'm coming!"


3. The house is still lying on its face -- er, its door -- kicking its legs, struggling to get up. Singing Cricket and his students are still trapped inside. Kayra approaches at a run. "The house! It's alive??"


4. Kayra pushes the house upright, and Singing Cricket pops his head out of the tiny door. "Oh! Hey, babe." Kayra, surprised to see him, says, "I thought you'd KILLED the house! You've been hiding it from Granny this whole time??"


5. Kayra kisses Singing Cricket as he climbs out of the house. "You stupid, wonderful man! I should have known you'd never hurt such a sweet little thing!"

"Do you think Granny Dismal will be upset if she finds out?" replies Singing Cricket, through the kiss.

The big guy peers out the door, smiling as he watches them reconcile.


6. Her arms wrapped around Singing Cricket's neck, Kayra replies happily, ignoring his worried expression. "For lying to her? Oh, she'd definitely kill you. But only after several centuries under increasingly horrible and imaginative curses!"

Behind them, the dwarf's hand grabs the big guy's shoulder. He looks at it with a "?".


7. The door of the house clicks shut. "Actually, she's been asking for you," says Kayra. She closes her eyes happily and nuzzle's Singing Cricket's neck while he grits his teeth and sweats. "I think she misses you, too. I'm so happy you're coming home!"
