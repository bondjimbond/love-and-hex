1. Kayra leads Charlie the owlbear, still hypnotized (indicated by swirly eyes), away from Nanny's house through the woods. Some myconids are playing dice in the background. She's finished babysitting for Singing Cricket. "You were very helpful today, Charlie. But now it's time to bring you back to your daddy."


2. Deeper into the woods, Kayra stops. "Let's get you back to normal first..." She snaps her fingers, and Charlie's eyes go back to normal. "My husband is working very hard to tame you, and he enjoys it SO much."


3. Kayra and Charlie peer out through the bushes at Singing Cricket and his students engaged in a training session. Alcohol is prominently featured. Kayra smiles as she watches. "Oh, good! They're playing!"


4. "Why don't you go and join them?" Kayra says. She smacks Charlie on the bottom, and he runs off. "GRRAAAGH!"


5. Kayra watches, smiling, as Charlie goes off to join his "master". Exclamations from off-panel: "What is that thing?" "RRAAGH!" "Ye gods! We're under attack!"


6. Kayra starts walking away as the off-panel exclamations continue: "Charlie! DownAAARGH!" "CHOMP" "My leg!" She clutches her hands to her chest as she happily muses, "They're so cute together!"
