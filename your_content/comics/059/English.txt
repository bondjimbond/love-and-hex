1. An introspective Tamilda lies on the floor, watching the ants and beetles defend themselves against the zombie bugs. She allows a beetle to crawl onto her hand. Alond enters the house, dragging the body of some horrific tentacled thing. He gasps upon seeing Tamilda. "My champion!"


2. Alond seizes Tamilda by the forearm and drags her away. "Come, it's not safe here." "Urk" says Tamilda as she's yanked away from the bugs. The beetle falls from her hand.


3. Alond tents his fingers and looks to the side, scheming. "I see you've got a magic sword! VERY nice. Let's go over the plan. You'll have to take out Granny Dismal first..."


4. Alond's jaw drops at Tamilda's response: "I'm not sure I want to kill the hags anymore. They've been... kind to me. SCARY, but kind."


5. Alond grabs her by the neck and lifts her off the floor. "Listen here, you little twerp. MY money bought that sword, and you're going to USE it like we PLANNED."


6. Alond continues, not noticing that Tamilda seems unintimidated. She raises a fist. "I may not have my magic anymore..." says Alond, "But I'd have NO trouble throttling a scrawny, uncooperative girl like --"


7. Alond's eyes widen when he notices Tamilda's hand, which has grown hair and claws and burst through her armour with a "snik". "... you..."


8. Alond sets Tamilda down and pats her on the back. "On the other hand," he says with a nervous smile, "You've been through a lot. Self-care is important. Take your time! The plan can wait." She walks away, rolling her eyes.
