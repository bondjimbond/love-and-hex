1. Nanny Muk, a horrific grinning monstrous green hag with pointy teeth and creatures living in her hair, happily cooks sausages on a stove with the help of a raccoon. Singing Cricket and Kayra sit at a table in the background.

Singing Cricket: "So did you... um... return the baby already?"

Kayra: "What baby?"


2. The raccoon sets the table for the couple as they chat. Singing Cricket takes a drink.

Kayra: "Oh, THAT baby. Nanny Muk said she'd take care of it."

Singing Cricket: "Good."


3. Nanny Muk brings over a plate of sausages. Singing Cricket rubs his stomach hungrily.

Nanny Muk: "Who wants sausages?"

Kayra: "Ooh! Me! Me!"


4. Singing Cricket reaches for the plate. "They smell delicious!"

Nanny replies, "They're fresh!"


5. As Singing Cricket prepares to take a bite of a sausage, Nanny looks at him more intensely and continues, "I ground the meat this morning!" His eyes widen.


6. With a glare, Singing Cricket places the sausage back on the plate. Nanny looks sad.
