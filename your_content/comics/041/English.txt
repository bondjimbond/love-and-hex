1. Singing Cricket and Kayra approach an outdoor bar, manned by a big bald bartender. A dwarf stands at the bar with a mug of ale, looking at them scornfully.

Singing Cricket: "Two ciders, please."

Dwarf: "Ha!"


2. Kayra rolls her eyes as the dwarf scoffs. Singing Cricket seems unaffected by their scorn. 

Dwarf: "Who's this flash jessie, drinkin' apple juice like a wee girl?"

Singing Cricket: "It's tasty!"

Dwarf: "Pah! REAL men quaff strong dwarven ale!"


3. The dwarf gets up in Singing Cricket's face. He looks intrigued and purses his lips.

Singing Cricket: "Ooh, have you got some?"

Dwarf: "Ah! So ye aim tae PROVE yer a real man, do ye?"

Singing Cricket: "That's not necessary, but but I'd love a--"

Dwarf: "I'll out-drink you any day! LINE 'EM UP!"


4. A line of mugs is set up at the bar. Kayra gives Singing Cricket a kiss as she leaves.

Dwarf: "As many as you can in one minute!"

Kayra: "I'll leave you to it."


5. A montage of the dwarf drinking mugs of ale: "One! Two!" .. "Five! Six!" "Seven! Eight!" "Nine--" 

Off-panel, Singing Cricket interrupts with "One- BURRP!"


6. The dwarf laughs derisively. "ONE?! HA! What'd I tell ye..."


7. The dwarf and bartender's eyes widen as the look at Singing Cricket, who is sitting on a stool and wiping his mouth, holding an entire ale barrel.

Singing Cricket: "Excuse me! One more, please!"
