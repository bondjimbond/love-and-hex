1. Kayra stands in front of a wardrobe full of clothes. The wardrobe's toothy mouth is open wide to reveal the clothes inside. It stares down at her with a single large eye, and helpfully offers Kayra a dress on a hanger with a pseudopod. Kayra is facing away from the camera, wearing only her underwear. She drops her bloodstained dress into a basket next to her. Tamilda stands nearby.

Kayra: "Your way of hunting is fun, but it's messy! Let's get out of these bloody clothes."

Tamilda: "I didn't bring anything else."


2. Kayra pulls on a long-sleeved, striped short dress. 

Kayra: "I'm sure I have something nicer for you than that old armour."

Tamilda, annoyed: "What's wrong with my armour? I found it in a goblin cave!"

Kayra: "It SMELLS like you found it in a goblin cave... On the OTHER hand, it's getting too SMALL for you."


3. CAPTION: "Soon..."

Tamilda wears a T-shirt and pants that are way too big for her. "Sigh... too big."


4. Tamilda holds up the cups of a sparkly, Jessica Rabbit style cocktail dress that is way too big for her, eyes wide. "I don't think THIS will EVER fit me."


5. Tamilda dressed in a villanous-looking bodysuit covered in skulls and fishnets. She looks pleased. "This one's cool."

Kayra, off-panel: "Oh, I think that belonged to Granny."


6. Tamilda wearing a cute but ill-fitting frilly dress. She swishes her hips to show it off. She looks happy with it.

Tamilda: "I LOVE this outfit."

Kayra: "Then it's yours!"


7. Off-panel, Kayra adds, "But you'll have to grow into it." Tamilda holds her chin, thoughtfully.


8. Tamilda: "Hang on..." She grits her teeth and starts to change.


9. Tamilda is now a tall, buff, wolf-girl, and the outfit is now tight on her (possibly too small). She shows it off.

Tamilda: "How about now?"

Kayra: "Perfect!"
