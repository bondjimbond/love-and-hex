1. Singing Cricket, wearing his false moustache and covered in dust and soot, walks out of a sooty alleyway with a concerned look. He brushes some soot off his arm. An armoured hand reaches for him from behind.

Singing Cricet: "Why does this keep happening?"


2. Belavor, a handsome half-elf in full plate and a badge, with short-cropped hair and a thin cop moustache, holds Singing Cricket by the shoulder. Singing Cricket is pleased to see him.

Belavor: "Pardon me, citizen... I'm investigating a disturbance that took place in this vicinity. I'd like to ask you some questions."

Singing Cricket: "Belavor! Good to see you!"


3. Belavor pulls out a notebook and a pencil, and looks at Singing Cricket narrowly.

Belavor: "That's CAPTAIN ALBREK to you, citizen. Or SIR BELAVOR if I'm off-duty. Now, where were you at the time of the explosion?"

Singing Cricket: "Buddy, it's me! Singing Cricket! We defeated Alond together and saved the kingdom? I'll tell him you said hi!"


4. Belavor crosses his arms. "Sir, impersonating another citizen is a serious offence. PARTICULARLY if it's a hero of the realm. What is your REAL name?"

Singing Cricket puts a hand on his shoulder and winks conspiratorially. "It's me! I'm incognito!"

Belavor: "And how do you spell that, Mr. Cognito-- SINGING CRICKET?!"

Singing Cricket: "Hey, pal. Good to see you!"


6. Belavor stalks off, looking serious, a hand on his sword. "We'll have to catch up later, Cricket. There's a DANGEROUS TROUBLEMAKER on the loose -- and he's POSING as YOU!"

Singing Cricket looks perplexed at his moustahce: "?"
