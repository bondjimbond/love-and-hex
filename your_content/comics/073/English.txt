1. Kayra leads Singing Cricket through Nanny Muk's mimic house as doors and furniture watch them. "See?" says Kayra. "Nothing's changed. It's the same old house as before."

Singing Cricket is not buying it. "That's how mimics GET you! They wait till you think everything's fine, and then CHOMP!"


2. Nanny Muk approaches, knitting something. "Oh, no, dearie. Mimics this size are old and tame. He's perfectly agreeable, so long as he's well fed." In the background, a mouse approaches a hole in the wall.


3. Singing Cricket, gritting his teeth and still afraid, tentatively approaches the door and pats it. "All right... um... GOOD house... Niiice house..." The door smiles at him. Nanny and Kayra are pleased with this progress.

In the background, the mouse enters the hole in the wall, which sprouts teeth.


4. The door extends a pseudopod and touches Singing Cricket affectionately on the shoulder. Kayra approaches. "See, husband? The house LIKES you."

Singing Cricket nervously replies, "Maybe, but... What if it gets HUNGRY?"


5. Nanny replies, "He had a big meal just this morning! Mimics are ambush predators, and prey wanders by regularly." Her knitting has progressed - it looks to be a onesie with a hole in the back for a tail.

The house wraps Singing Cricket in a friendly pseudopod embrace. Hearts appear. "Oof!" he says. "That's good... All right. I think I'll be OK."


6. The scene shifts outside, to the forest path that leads to the house. In captions, Singing Cricket continues, "Wait... What KIND of prey?"

Along the path are numerous signs directing visitors to the mimic house:

"Rich old widow's house. Visitors welcome. Please don't rob"

"Solicitors welcome"

"Talk to me about your gods! Ahead"

"Lost Cat. Only companion to a blind old woman. REWARD: 500 gold pcs. Inquire at cottage."
