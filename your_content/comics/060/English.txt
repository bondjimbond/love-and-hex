1. Kayra looks in the mirror while she brushes her hair. In the second mirror, her doppelganger reaches out and picks up her own hairbrush.


2. Kayra gasps in shock as she sees a bump on her nose.


3. A beetle is approached by a zombie ant and two zombie beetles. It cowers in fear.


4. The door slams into the zombie bugs, squishing them and saving the beetle. It had been opened by Kayra, shouting "Husband!"


5. Singing Cricket is sitting at a table playing board game that looks a bit like Chess or Thud on a six-sided board, with Calvin, Nanny Muk's soulless servant/husband. He looks over at Kayra.

Kayra: "There is a WART! On my NOSE!"

Singing Cricket: "Really? Let me see."


6. Singing Cricket's finger comes close to the bump on Kayra's nose. "Babe, that's not a wart..."


7. The bump has crawled off of Kayra's nose and onto Singing Cricket's hand. "...It's just a beetle taking a rest." Kayra blushes in embarrassed surprise.


8. Singing Cricket grins. "See? Your skin is just as smooth and perfect as ever."


9. Singing Cricket is puzzled as Kayra runs away crying, "Boo hoo hooo!"
