1. The Changeling, looking human, is about to leave the house, when her mother interrupts her, touching her shoulder.

Mother: "Where are you off to, sweetie?"
Changeling: "I'm heading into town to see Jonathan. There's... something I need to tell him."

2. Her mother redirects Changeling-Kayra into her bedroom with a smile. Changeling-Kayra protests, but is ignored.

Mother: "Kayra, dear, your wedding is only DAYS away."
Changeling: "I know. And that's why--"
Mother: "And the groom simply CAN'T see the bride before the wedding! It's bad luck!"

3. Changeling-Kayra sits down in front of her dresser, which includes a large mirror. Her mother, leaving, pokes her head through the door with a big grin and a wink before she closes it.

Mother: "Besides, we've got a lot of work to do on your HAIR. Sit tight, I'll fetch a comb."
Changeling :"But mother, I really NEED --"
Mother: "Oh, I KNOW you NEED it, honey. But save it for the WEDDING NIGHT!"

4. Changeling-Kayra touches her face, looking at her reflection in the mirror. While her physical form looks human, she sees her true self -- a construct of mud and sticks with huge button eyes -- looking back at her.

Changeling: "Right. The wedding NIGHT. ... And how's THAT going to work??"
