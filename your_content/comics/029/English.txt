1. Outdoors in the city, a large townhouse covered in vines with a "For Sale" sign posted outside. A "SOLD" sticker covers the sign's text. A finely-dressed elderly couple walk past. The woman has her husband on a leash. A caption reads, "Meanwhile, in Kingsport"

Woman: "Ooh, new neighbours!"


2. Tamilda sits at a table eating a meal, with a goblin named Squat, and the soul bag. Behind her, a huge treasure hoard, taken from Alond's secret caches, sits nestled around the dragon egg. The egg has a crown on top of it.

Tamilda: "And she keeps calling him 'husband'!"

Squat: "Master got married and he didn't TELL me?!"

Tamilda: "You need to stop calling him that."


3. A large half-orc man with a three-pronged mohawk, Trip, appears with a wheelbarrow containing a large sack.

Trip: "That's the last of it, miss. Where do you want it?"

Tamilda: "Just pile it on with the rest. Thanks, Trip." She adds, "And no, they're not married. It's weird."


4. Tamilda and Squat get back to their discussion, while Trip climbs a footstool and pours the treasure out onto the pile. Much of it strikes the dragon egg.

Tamilda: "So what will you do with your share of the king's treasure?"

Squat: "Umm... Open a restaurant? If... if that's OK..."


5. Tamilda says, "Of COURSE it's OK, Squat. You're a brilliant--" and she's interrupted by a loud CRACK coming from the egg. A large crack has appeared in the shell. She looks upset. They both turn toward it.

Tamilda: "Trip! Be careful with that egg!"

Squat: "That's all right. It will make a lovely quiche..."


6. Tamilda smiles widely while Squat hides behind a chair, as they watch a set of scaly claws emerge from the eggshell.

Squat: "Oh! Umm... Maybe a roast?"
