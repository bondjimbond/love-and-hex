1. Kayra embraces Singing Cricket from behind as he downs a bottle of something. Alond expresses his shock at what just happened with Granny's poison.

Alond: "I saw what Granny Dismal put in your drink. I've never even HEARD of some of those poisons! Yet you not only SURVIVED, you had her make you three more! How did you do it?"

Karya: "He's my big strong man!"

2. In the background, Kayra walks off, snapping for the two chair-creatures to follow. Alond and Singing Cricket continue their conversation.

Alond: "Seriously, you should be a PUDDLE. How did you survive?"

Singing Cricket: "Purity of mind and body."

3. Singing Cricket narrates in captions over an image of two Drunken Master monks practicing their art.

Singing Cricket: "In my order, we use alcohol as inspiration for the unpredictable swaying movements that are the core of our martial art..."

4. Narration continues, over an image of a man's body in lotus position, chi flowing through him, surrounded by booze.

Singing Cricket: "...And as a shortcut to focus our chi - the vital energy flowing through all living things. Through intense training and experience, we can learn to control our chi flow, and achieve total mastery of the body."

5. Scene shifts back to Alond and Singing Cricket.

Singing Cricket: "My body and chi are so perfectly attuned, that any TOXINS or DISEASES that enter my body are IMMEDIATELY PURGED!" 

Alond: "Oh!"

6. Alond puts a hand on Singing Cricket's shoulder as Singing Cricket cries.

Alond: "I'm truly sorry."

Singing Cricket: "I miss it SO MUCH!"
