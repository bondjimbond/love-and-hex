1. Singing Cricket sits shirtless with Kayra, in a negligee, on top of a unicorn. They are drinking from glasses garnished with holly sprigs, including the poisonous berries.

Kayra: "Happy winter solstice, husband! Is there a special way you'd like to celebrate?"

SC: "Well... there is ONE thing... How about a little... Holiday role-play?"


2. Kayra smiles seductively (?) and touches his blushing face. "Ooh, bad boy. All right... that sounds fun."


3. Kayra gets up and walks away. "And I think I have juuuuust the right outfit. I'll be right back. No peeking!"


4. From off-panel, Kayra calls, "I'm reeeady... Have you been a good boy, or a NAUGHTY boy?" Singing Cricket grins excitedly, while the unicorn looks at him with annoyance.


5. Singing Cricket leans back, looking cool. The unicorn rolls its eyes. "I've been naughty... VERY naughty."

Kayra, off-panel, replies, "Oh, dear! Then you must be PUNISHED!"


6. Kayra leaps into the room, in fur, hooves, and horns, her needle teeth bared and forked tongue flying out. She has a basket on her back and a bundle of birch twigs in one hand -- she's dressed as Krampus. Singing Cricket is terrified as she shouts in an eldritch voice, "NOW GET IN THE BASKET!"
