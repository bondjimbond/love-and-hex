1. The dwarf, looking worried, helps the big guy up. The big guy is just smiling adoringly at the dwarf. 

Dwarf: "What's happening to the house? I KNEW it dinnae look structurally sound!"

Singing Cricket responds angrily as he helps the imp up: "There's nothing wrong with the house!"


2. Singing Cricket looks suddenly worried. "Oh, no... What if Granny Dismal found it??" The imp, sitting on his shoulder, pats his head comfortingly.


3. The house begins to shake yet again. The floor tilts, throwing the big guy off balance. The imp takes to the air. Singing Cricket and the dwarf run for the door.

"Ye gods," says the dwarf. "She could be choppin' it up as we speak!"


4. CAPTION: Outside

A zoomed-in view of the outdoors. Mushrooms, rocks, and grass surround a frog sitting peacefully on the ground. The frog says "Croooa..."


5. Suddenly a huge pair of bird feet CRASH to the ground where the frog was sitting. The frog leaps out of the way, and finishes its sentance as it looks back in horror: "--AAK!"


6. The baby house gives a cheerful "Chirrp" through its chimney as it follows the frog, jumping after it. From the window can be heard, "I can't reach the door!"


7. The house lands with a BOOM and turns around, following the frog. From the window: "Excuse me, but I think you're on my face."


8. The frog leaps away, and the house jumps to follow. From the window: "Crivvens, the hag is TORTURIN' the puir wee thing!"


9. The house trips and falls flat onto where its face would be if it had a face, meaning the door is on the ground. The frog leaps away as from the window we hear, "The door won't open! She's onto us!"
