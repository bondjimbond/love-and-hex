1. In the forest, Charlie the owlbear is held by a rope around his neck. He is scrabbling ferociously at Singing Cricket, who is holding up a chicken. The chicken looks nonplussed.

Singing Cricket: "All right, Charlie... Sit, and you can have this tasty chicken!"


2. Kayra approaches from behind Singing Cricket. He turns to talk to her, while still holding up the chicken. Charlie's claws can be seen scrabbling for it from off-panel.

Kayra, looking annoyed: "Husband, the forest is FULL of rabbits, foxes, skunks... Of all the creatures to pretend was your pet, why an OWLBEAR?"

Singing Cricket, looking despondent: "I was in a hurry!"


3. Singing Cricket turns to face Kayra, still holding his arm with the chicken off-panel, where "RAWR" and "GRAGH" can be heard.

Kayra: "Well, Granny seemed to believe you. Are you REALLY going to train him?"

Singing Cricket, looking worried: "She gave me two weeks!"


4. Kayra looks concerned. "What do you suppose she'll do if you fail?"

Singing Cricket: "I don't want to think about it. I'll just focus on Charlie's obedience training--"

Off-panel, the rope snaps. "BAWK!"


4. Kayra, looking away, winces. Singing Cricket grits his teeth as feathers fly from off-panel. SFX: CHOMP


5. Kayra starts walking away. "I'll get you another chicken."

Singing Cricket, looking unhappy: "That won't be necessary..."


6. Singing Cricket: "But..."

The chicken runs away as the camera zooms out, revealing Singing Cricket with his arm shoulder-deep down Charlie's throat. The owlbear is chewing on him: "cruch, munch"

Singing Cricket: "If you have any healing potions..."
