1. In the forest, late at night. Dark, shadows. Tamilda is collecting mushrooms, and reaches down to grab a walking mushroom that's running away. With smile she says, "Hey, you, come back here."

In the foreground, deep in shadow, a large man in a flannel shirt and a full-face mask watches, holding a large machete.


2. The masked man slashes at Tamilda, but she dodges out of the way with a "Waugh!"


3. Brushing the dirt off her face, Tamilda starts to get up. Her mushroom basket is spilled. 

Tamilda: "*pant* *pant* Uh... nice knife. What's it made of?"

The Slasher looks at his knife and fingers it. "?"


4. Tamilda continues her line of inquiry. "Magic iron? Silver alloy?"

The perplexed slasher shrugs.


5. Close-up on Tamilda, grinning. Panel shows half her face. "Normal steel, then?"


6. Panel showing the other half of her face, transforming into a wolf. "Just checking."


7. A few moments later, the slasher, now bleeding with torn clothing, flees, leaving drops of blood behind. He looks back at Tamilda, clearly afraid. Tamilda ignores him, though, looking down angrily at her torn clothing. "Dang it, I just GOT this dress!"
