1. A frog sits, pretty chill, on a lily pad in a swamp. A hand reaches down toward it.

2. Tamilda, with a sword strapped to her back, holds the frog in her hands. Eyes closed, she gives it a kiss, with a big SMOOCH in the background.

3. Tamilda recoils from a big POOF of smoke.

4. A muscular prince, with curly hair, a pencil moustache, a crown, and a long nose, looks at his hands in delighted astonishment.

Prince: "Ye gods - I'm human! With TRUE LOVE'S KISS, my curse of these two hundred years is broken at last!"

5. The prince, who is clad only in crown and boxer shorts with a crown pattern on them, takes Tamilda's hand in both of his and gets down on one knee in the swampy water, among the reeds cattails. Tamilda grins awkwardly and looks away from him.

Prince: "And by such a fair maid! My love, I thiank thee for freeing me with thy sweet kiss. But let us tarry not, lest the witch of these woods discover us! Come, we must make haste to my castle, where we shall be wed anon!"

Tamilda: "Riiight... And where in the woods EXACTLY would that nasty old witch be found?"

Prince: "The hags dwell just over yon hillside. But worry not, my beloved! Our path shall not cross those wyrd sisters."

6. With a smile, Tamilda sprints off in the direction of the forested hill. The prince, confused and distraught, reaches for her. A little frog on a nearby lily pad turns to watch.

Tamilda: "Thanks! We were supposed to meet this morning, and I'm SUPER late. I'd swear the trees here change the paths for fun. I hope I haven't missed dinner!"

Prince: "But - fair maid --"

Tamilda: "Have fun being human!"

7. The prince watches sadly as Tamilda disappears into the hills.

Prince: "But... My one true love..."

8. The prince crouches in the swamp and dips his finger into the water, his eyes downcast. The frog looks at him.

Prince: "Sigh... It was nice, being a frog."
